<P> CHAPTER VIII
<P> <i><b>THE NORTHERN CRATER</i></b>
<P>The Gaea’s cliffs stretched around him, white everywhere as snow
flittered to the ground. The newly fallen flakes were soft beneath his feet,
crunching softly and leaving tracks as he ascended the mountains. The tracks were not viable for long, as the snow filled the holes almost as quickly as they had been made.
<P>Cloud didn’t know how long he had been scaling the mountains. He had lost
track of time, his mind too numb to comprehend anything but the biting
winds and the below zero temperature. His hands, sore and scratched,
automatically reached for the next handhold above him. Occasionally his numb fingers refused to grip, and he had to focus on simply closing them round the icy stones and rocks embedded in the mountainside.
<P>He had to get to Sephiroth. He had all the answers, and he would pay for
his attempt upon Aeris’s life.
<P>He found his mind wandering back to the ‘clone’ that had sacrificed
himself upon the altar at the City of the Ancients, but before he could think of much-needed answers, he realised his handholds had run out.
<P>Looking up, he saw he had finally reached the top of the cliffs. Gaining 
energy simply from that realisation, he hurried the last few steps to the
peak.
<P>The view was indescribable, with the snow falling gently around him and
the softly glowing crater before him. Yet Cloud did not stay to admire the 
beauty of it. He stopped only for a few moments to catch his breath, and 
then continued into the crater.
<P>Sephiroth was there, and Cloud had to get to him quickly.
<HR>
The Chaos Beast was having a hard time fighting the elements, especially 
with the feverish girl in his arms. So when a cave came into view below 
them, it flew towards it gladly.
<P>It landed inside the small cave, setting Aeris to the ground. They were 
protected from the bitter wind, yet it was still freezing. The milky
white snow was falling thick and fast, making it nearly impossible to carry on.
<P>Aeris seemed to be getting worse, Chaos observed to itself. She had not
sat up from where it had laid her. He walked over to her, hiding any signs of tiredness if he felt any.
<P>“Do you want to stay here until the weather lets up?” It asked her. Aeris
shook her head, slowly sitting up.
<P>“We can’t,” she stated. “We have to get to Sephiroth before Cloud does.”
She stood up, using all her energy to remain standing. “We can’t afford to
stop and rest.”
<P>Chaos nodded, knowing she was right. He walked up to the edge of the
cave, glancing up. The wind was harsh and biting and the snowflakes cold, yet they had to go o. They simply had to.
<P>Aeris ran a hand across her fevered brow. The Lifestream was in turmoil
and there was nothing she could do except sit back and suffer the
consequences. She couldn’t contact her mother amidst the misty voices. She had never felt so alone, and so unsure.
<P>Chaos gently lifted her back into the air, and back out into the
treacherous weather. The wind attacked them with full force, and snow fell onto Aeris’s exposed arms. The flakes were a slight relief to her, as it calmed her fever slightly, yet she knew it wouldn’t be long until numbness set into her body again. She glanced up at Chaos, wondering if it could feel the coldness through its thick leathery wings, and whether they’d drop from the sky if he should lose a grip on her due to numb fingers. Yet it seemed to be flying with no problems.
<P>The mountains below them seemed to show no signs of anyone trekking up
them. Aeris hoped they weren’t that far behind Cloud, and also that he had even survived the horrific journey.
<P>Aeris didn’t want to think about that. She closed her eyes, letting the
wind and the Chaos Beast guide them. She’d have the answers to her questions
soon enough.
<HR>
Cloud was glad to be back on solid ground once again. All the climbing he
had endured, as well as the condition of the weather, has only exhausted 
him. Yet he still trudged wearily on, placing one foot in front of the
other as a means of necessity. Looking for Sephiroth was his one goal. He
glanced around, searching for his foe.
<P>And there he was, clear as day, right in front of him. Cloud blinked and 
shook his head, certain he had not been there a few moments ago. The man
had his sword unsheathed, yet Cloud did not draw his own.
<P>“You came,” Sephiroth stated bluntly. “Fool. You will never win against
me.”
<P>“I have no intentions of fighting…” Cloud said, a touch of melancholy in
his words. “I just want answers. Why did you try to kill Aeris? Who was that
man who died in who place?”
<P>Before Sephiroth could answer, if he had any intentions of doing so, they
heard a shout from the distance. Looking up, they saw the Chaos Beast
flying towards them, carrying what appeared to be Aeris in his claws.
<P>The two landed a few feet away, Chaos transforming as soon as he had set 
Aeris down. The girl began running towards him, using what appeared to be
all her energy to remain standing. Vincent ran after her as soon as he
was able.
<P>“Cloud!” Aeris yelled. “Cloud, listen to me!”
<P>Cloud turned and studied Aeris as she stopped in front of him, and
reached forward to put a hand on her shoulder.
<P>“You’re sick,” he stated. Aeris’s condition was worsening still, and
anyone around her could see it. “You shouldn’t be here!”
<P>“Listen to us Cloud,” Vincent said as he met the two. “Give us the Black 
Materia.”
<P>Cloud looked at them both, surprised. He had almost forgotten about the 
black orb he had been carrying. Did they not trust him with it? Did they 
think his sanity was so fragile that he would let it get into the wrong 
hands?
<P>“It’s safe with me,” he reassured them. “Don’t worry about it.”
<P>“Cloud,” Aeris said, almost frantically. “You must give it to us.”
<P>“No. Come here.”
<P>They turned to see Sephiroth, beckoning to Cloud with an evil gleam in
his eye. He had sheathed his sword, and if any of them had thought about it,
he would have been easy to defeat at that point.
<P>But they didn’t think about it. Vincent and Aeris were looking at Cloud,
who was slowly walking towards Sephiroth.
<P>“Wake up,” Sephiroth called softly as Cloud neared him.
<P>The blond haired man cried out in pain, and sunk to his knees, hands 
clutching at his hair and his temples so hard his knuckles were white.
<P>“Give it to me.”
<P>Aeris ran forward to assist Cloud at Sephiroth’s words, but Vincent held
her back. They had saved her once; he didn’t want their efforts and the
future Cloud’s death to be in vain should Sephiroth try again.
<P>Cloud slowly got to his feet again, and continued walking towards
Sephiroth. It looked at though he was being manipulated, and that he was fighting it. His steps were slow and unsure, and he would stop after two or three and clutch at his head again. Tears shone out in his mako blue eyes, though whether it was from pain or the knowledge that he was about to give 
Sephiroth the Black Materia, Vincent and Aeris didn’t know.
<P>Cloud eventually reached Sephiroth, holding his hand out, the black orb 
glistening invitingly.
<P>“NO!”
<P>Aeris struggled free of Vincent’s grasp then, running to Cloud’s side.
She needed to stop him. Sephiroth couldn’t get the Black Materia, he just 
couldn’t!
<P>Sephiroth took it before Aeris could reach them, a wicked smile etched in
his features.
<P>Aeris fell to the ground as she saw that, her disappointment and fever 
weakening her to the point that she couldn’t remain standing.
<P>Sephiroth had won. He had the Black Materia.
<P>Aeris put her head into her hands, and cried, despair reigning over her. 
Nothing more could be done. Meteor would be summoned, and the Planet 
obliterated.
<P>All she could do now was to sit back and watch the Planet her race had 
saved, be destroyed.
