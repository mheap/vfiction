<P> CHAPTER III
<P> <i><b>FATE IS NOT OURS</i></b>
<P>So, this is the Sleeping Forest. 
<P>It didn't look asleep to Aeris as she walked down the path
into the thick growth of trees and lush vegetation. No.  The
forest was bursting with life. A vast array of colours,
lights and sounds. Creatures of different kinds and sizes
ran to and fro the foliage and the terrain. 
<P>The forest was everything but sleeping to those it welcomed. 
<P>She was one of them. 
<P>Sitting down to pick up a purple blossom, Aeris sighed and
raised her eyes to the blue sky peeking out from above a
canopy of trees and leaves. A group of white and brown birds
flew above her leaving the sounds of their joyful cacking. 
<P>She closed her eyes to listen some more to the orchestra of
sounds. A bumblebee buzzing as it went from one flower to
another. The whistle of the wind as it blew past the trees.
The gurgling of a nearby brook as it the waters hit the
rocks. 
<P>Was this the Promised Land, she wondered. In this place
alone, she felt safe from any dangers outside the barriers
of the forest. It was to her advantage for she knew that
what she had to do would be walking straight into the hands
of danger. 
<P>For her, fear had no place in her heart now. Only love and
determination to protect the Planet and all it's creatures. 
<P>A twig snapped behind her, bringing her out of her reverie.
It was followed by heavy footsteps as if they were being
dragged across the grass.  Then a voice calling out her
name. His voice. 
<P>"Cloud?!" She cried as she spun around to see her friend
limping towards her. She was more upset than surprised to
see him here, but what caught her attention was his
staggering and poor posture. 
<P>One hand clasped to his midsection as his other hand
desperately tried to drag his enormous sword. His feet moves
slowly across the ground.  His face was haggard and tired,
his breathing was tortured. 
<P>Shaking away her questions and worries, she ran to his side
just in time to catch him as he fell on his knees. 
<P>"Wh-what happened to you? What are you doing here?" She
asked him, unable to mask her disappointment in being found
so soon. He didn't answer, still struggling to regain his
composure. "Cloud...you shouldn't have left the town alone." 
<P>She was referring to Gongaga.  That was the last place they
have been after they visited the Temple of the Ancients. She
recalled him being controlled by Sephiroth and even
attacking her as the madman fled. Cloud was knocked out cold
when she left Gongaga for the Sleeping Forest. 
<P>"You shouldn't have left the town alone either." He said. 
His voice barely audible as he continued to breathe heavily.
"What you're going to do is dangerous, Aeris. You're going
to get killed." 
<P>Aeris shook her head. "No, the Planet will protect me." 
<P>"Protect you?! The Planet can't even protect itself, how can
it protect you?" He snapped at her, making her pull away
from him in fright. 
<P>"But I--" 
<P>Cloud pressed his midsection tighter and stifled a grunt. 
Then opened his eyes and looked directly at her. "You're
going to the Forgotten Capital to summon Holy, right?" 
<P>She didn't answer, taken aback by what he just said. 
<P>"Am I right?" He repeated, more forcefully this time. 
<P>"Yes. How did you know?" She had hoped that nobody would
find out her mission. This dangerous mission that only she,
an Ancient, could fulfill. She was afraid of this. That one
of her friends would tag along. They didn't have to be
involved in this. 
<P>"Just trust me." He said in a low tone again his voice
filled with pain. "Sephiroth will kill you." He fell silent
, battling the pain inside his body for a full minute before
taking a deep breath and straightening up his body. 
<P>When the pain was finally gone, he looked at her face again,
surprised to see her wearing a calm expression on her face. 
<P>"It could happen." She replied slowly. "But what other
choice to do we have? Sephiroth is going to summon a meteor
to destroy the Planet, Cloud. Holy is the only chance we
have to survive." 
<P>Cloud didn't move.  Instead, he was shocked by her reaction,
rather than her being shocked by the news that she would die
in a few hours. "I know." He whispered. "But it's---I don't
want you to die." 
<P>"Are you going to try to stop me, then?" 
<P>"I don't know." He grasped his head in between his hands and
shut his eyes tightly. Visions of meteor destroying Midgar
burned in his head. Holy coming from the Norhtern Crater
and...not doing it's job. The last thing he remembered was
the Lifestream coming from the Planet and heading towards
Meteor.  There was a blinding light, then he and the rest of
his party wake up only to find out that they have been
brought back to the past.  Not knowing if they were really
successful at saving their future. 
<P>Now, he didn't know if it would be necessary for Aeris to
sacrifice herself all over again.  Or if he could live with
himself knowing that he just blew his second chance to save
her. 
<P>But, how does he explain all this to her? 
<P>"Sephiroth!" Aeris gasped. 
<P>Cloud opened his eyes, alerted by her scream and found the
black robed man walking towards them. He carried his long
blade, the masamune in one hand. Lips twisted in an evil
sneer and his eyes focused mockingly on their faces. 
<P>He wasted no time. Ignoring the weakness and the pain, Cloud
sprung to his feet and held Aeris behind him. "Stop, right
there!" He commanded, but Sephiroth merely snickered and
continued walking towards them. 
<P>"I'm warning you..--" Cloud was interrupted as his right leg
gave way underneath him, thanks to fatigue. But he refused
to let that stop him.  Sephiroth was just a few steps away
from them. He grabbed Aeris' staff, since he had no strength
to weild his sword, and held it defensively with both hands. 
<P>Sephiroth stopped right in front of them and observed Cloud
as he struggled to stay on his feet. "What's this?" He said.
"The puppet dares disobey it's master?" 
<P>"I'm not a puppet anymore, Sephiroth." Cloud hissed.  "Not
like you.  I'm free of the bonds that tie me to JENOVA." 
<P>Sephiroth threw back his head and  let out a chuckle, which
turned into an outright laughter. "That is most improbable.
Mother owns you, body and soul just as she owns this Planet.
That is why, I, as her son, deserve to rule over all its
creatures." He looked at Cloud with eyes that burned like
embers. "And you are simply an accessory to carry out
Mother's desires." 
<P>Cloud grinned at Sephiroth mockingly. "You'd be surprised at
how you're going to fail." 
<P>Sephiroth chuckled again, taking his sword out of the safe
position and pointing it at Cloud's throat. "I didn't fail
back at the Ancient's Temple, did I? Just look at your
companion's pretty face. Her scars and bruises all came from
your hand." 
<P>Cloud looked back at Aeris and finally noticed the wounds
that she hid behind her thick hair. He knew that Sephiroth
was right. 
<P>"Not anymore, Sephiroth.  You, JENOVA, or any other puppet
will not harm her again. I won't allow it." 
<P>As those words left Cloud's lips, Sephiroth stepped forward
and jabbed the sword right through the staff and flipped it
far away. With another quick move, he sidestepped and drove
a fist at Cloud's midsection, causing the young SOLDIER to
double over in pain. 
<P>"Ah..pathetic." Sephiroth said clicking his tongue in
disappointment. "I will enjoy killing you...both." He turned
around and walked back the way he came, disappearing in the
mist. 
<P>"Damn!" Cloud groaned, slamming a fist on the ground. Once
again he stood helpless against the river. Unable to stop
it's flow a second time. "I-I'm sorry, Aeris.  I tried to
protect you..." 
<P>"It's okay." She said, laying a hand on his shoulders and
trying to comfort him. "There'll always be next time." 
<P>"No!" He suddenly snapped. "It's going to happen all over
again! He'll make me watch you die all over again.
And---God--I can't believe---I'm helpless. AGAIN! Don't you
understand?" 
<P>"No! No, I don't understand!" She cried, her eyes brimming
with tears. "What's going on, Cloud? Why are you acting this
way? Tell me!" 
<P>Cloud didn't move, he just kept his head bowed down. "All
right, I'll tell you--everything." 
<P>And he did, as they sat on the grass.  He told her how he
and their friends were pulled back into the past. What
happened the last time Aeris went to the Forgotten Capital.
He told her what happened to him in Lifestream and at the
Northern Crater.  Then he told her about Holy aiding  Meteor
in destroying Midgar. 
<HR>
Bone Village. Cid and Tifa waited impatiently for any sign
of their past counterparts to arrive. They had everything
prepared for them.  The Lunar Harp, the tool used to awaken
the Sleeping Forest, powerful materia and weapons. 
<P>"Do you think they'll buy it?" Cid asked. 
<P>"They have to if we're going to save our Cloud and Aeris."
Tifa answered, looking back towards the entrance of the
village. 
<P>"What do you think happened to the future, Tifa?" He spoke
again.  "Do you think that Meteor destroyed the world? Or do
you think that Lifestream was able to stop it?" 
<P>Tifa shrugged. She didn't know.  When they were on the
Highwind, everything looked bad. Meteor had already done
quite a lot of damage to Midgar even before Lifestream
appeared. But her mind drifted away to thoughts of Cloud. 
She was dead worried about him. Especially now at his
weakened state. 
<P>"I think I'll lie down for a while." She said, making her
way to the main tent of the village where the others waited.
"Call me when you see them coming, Cid." 
<P>Cid nodded and sat down on a rock that moved and tumbled as
he did. The pilot lost his balance and fell on the ground
muttering and cursing. 
<P>"Cid, you okay?" Tifa asked, not hiding her chuckle. 
<P>"Yeah, I'm $#%$#." Cid reached for Tifa's extend hand and
pulled himself to his feet, dusting his back. "Stupid rock!"
He cursed, kicking the solid object until it rolled over
once again. 
<P>"Hey, look!" Tifa said, pointing excitedly at a shining
object buried in the soil. 
<P>"Well, whatd'ya know?" Cid dropped on his knees and started
digging with his hands, until the object came into full
view. He picked up the dirty piece of metal and scraped off
the remaining dirt. "Now who would leave the Midgar key
lying around on the ground like that?" 
<P>Tifa let out a squeal of excitement. Hopefully, this was a
good omen that they would succeed. 
<P>"Tifa, Cid!" They heard Yuffie call.  They spotted her
running towards them from her look-out tree near the
village's entrance. "They're here! They just arrived on the
Baby Bronco." 
<P>"Tiny Bronco!" Cid corrected pocketing the Midgar Key.  Both
he and Tifa got on their feet.  "This is it." 
<P>Tifa nodded and took a deep breath. "Let's go." 
<HR>
Cloud lay down on one of the beds in the Forgotten Capital.
Fatigue had completely taken over him and he slept soundly.
He did not notice his companion tiptoe near him to check his
temperature with the back of her hand. Nor did he hear her
whisper the words:"I'm sorry, but I have to do this." 
<P>Then she ran out into the darkness as quickly as she could
before anyone else could stop her.
