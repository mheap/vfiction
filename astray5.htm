<H4>CHAPTER V</H4>
<P>Tifa rested her arms on the counter in front of her, bending her head wearily. It had been a busy night at the Halo and Horns. Not really a surprise for a Saturday. She had been running around like crazy earlier but things were calming down a little bit now, with only an hour to go before close. The colder it got out the busier it seemed to get. You would think people would want to stay home in this cold weather, but apparently that wasn't the case, at least not with the people who came here. At least she was off tomorrow so she'd have some time to recuperate.
<P>A Latin beat was playing on the jukebox, with a heavy base. Tifa could feel the floorboards underneath her vibrating from it. She could tell without even looking that Lasonya was dancing. Tifa knew she loved this kind of music, the beat pounding through her. Lasonya was young, almost as young as Delphine, and her dance was the most energetic of the lot. She literally flew around the stage, her long black hair flying behind her. It was a lively performance, and one that kept the crowds attention, which was perhaps another reason things had slowed down at the bar.
<P>Not that she paid much attention anyway. What took place on the stage didn't interest her. The bar was across the floor from the stage, and most of the time her view was obscured by people standing in between anyway.
<P>She picked up a rag from beneath the counter and began cleaning off the countertop.
<P>"Tifa, get me a drink, willya?"
<P>Tifa looked up as a busty platinum blonde plopped down on the barstool in front of her. She was wearing white shorts and a peach chiffon top that was almost completely transparent. She had blue eyes and the smallest nose Tifa had ever seen. She placed a tiny black pocketbook on the counter. Unsnapping it she rummaged around for a moment then pulled out a pack of cigarettes. Tapping one out between her bright red nails, she lit it up and placed it between her equally crimson lips.
<P>Alicia was the featured dancer at the Halo and Horns. She was older than Tifa, had turned thirty just this year, actually, though she tried to keep that a closely guarded secret. She had also been working here longer than just about anyone else, save Bernard of course. Her set had finished right before Lasonya's. 
<P>Tifa had been here just over year now. Alica had made it obvious right from the start they would not be friends. Tifa wasn't sure why. Caraca had told her it was because she was so pretty that Alicia thought of her as a threat. She couldn't really understand why. After all, she'd made it plain on more than one occasion that she had no interest in dancing. However, that little fact didn't seem to matter to Alicia. She was really the only one in the whole place Tifa didn't get along with. Why was there always one?
<P>"What do you want?" Tifa asked.
<P>"Oh I don't know hon, just get me anything. Long as it's got liquor in it."
<P>Tifa shrugged. She turned around and picked up one of the bottles, quickly whipping up a bloody Mary. She turned back and put it on the counter, thinking how well it matched the older woman's blood red claws, though she said nothing.
<P>Alicia picked it up and took a sip.
<P>"A little weak, don't you think?" she said disapprovingly, putting the glass back down on the counter. "I'm not one of those drunk ass guys you normally serve. Don't water them down for me."
<P>Tifa took the drink back, hiding her annoyance. She had made that drink just like she made any other, with no more or less liquor than anyone else. She remixed the drink, adding enough vodka to kill a cow, then slid it back in front of Alicia.
<P>Alicia lifted the glass and took a sip. She immediately coughed and held her throat for a moment.
<P>"Better?" Tifa asked.
<P>"Much," Alicia managed to say eventually. She took a long drag from her cigarette, blowing the smoke out in a long exhale, not exactly in Tifa's face, but close enough. Tifa turned away.
<P>"I heard Bernard tried to get you to dance again," Alicia spoke up after a moment.
<P>Tifa turned back to face her.
<P>"Yeah," she said slowly. Word sure traveled fast.
<P>"I suppose you turned him down?"
<P>Instead of replying immediately Tifa let the words hang in the air for a bit. She was tempted to say she was thinking about it. Wouldn't do any harm to lead her on, and it might be worth it just to see the look on the Alicia's face, but she was afraid if she did word of that might get back to Bernard, and she certainly didn't want him to think she was changing her mind.
<P>"Yes," she replied simply.
<P>"Good for you," Alicia said, looking relieved. "I think you should stick to your guns. Do what you know best, that's what I always say. Besides, I really don't think you'd make a very good dancer. You just don't have the personality for it."
<P>"You're probably right," Tifa replied, not much interested in the conversation.
<P>"Oh, I need to talk to you about something," Alicia went on. "We're working on some new routines and costumes that we're going to be using starting next month. Clarisse is a great seamstress and has agreed to make up most of the costumes for us and she needs to get started on it soon if we're going to have them in time. I'm going to need her to work on them on Monday and probably all week when she's not doing her set."
<P>When the girls weren't dancing, they worked as waitresses or barmaids, or in the kitchen. If Clarisse was working on the costumes Tifa would be short someone.
<P>"I don't know," she said slowly. "I don't know if I can spare her every night." 
<P>Alicia was the head dancer, she was in charge of the girls when they were in the backroom, but Tifa was in charge of the bar. If they were short it was her responsibility to make sure everything got done, which would probably mean she'd have to help out the waitresses as well as tend bar. She could probably swing it but she knew it wouldn't be fun, especially since it had been busier than usual lately. 
<P>"Oh, I'm sure you can handle it," Alicia said. "I'm afraid we don't have much choice. We have to have those costumes ready for next month."
<P>Which was still three weeks away. Did that mean that she would want to continue using Clarisse beyond next week as well? In any case Tifa didn't like it but it wasn't really something she felt she could say no to. She knew she could manage it even though it would suck. 
<P>"I'll see what I can do," she said resignedly.
<P>"Thanks, I really appreciate it hon," Alicia replied. 
<P>As she spoke the music stopped. There was scattered applause and a few drunken calls for more as Lasonya left the stage. Alicia picked up her purse and stood up.
<P>"Gotta get in the back and start cleaning up," she said, turning and walking away quickly. Tifa just looked at her back. She hadn't said for sure she would go along, but she knew there was no point in arguing, not with Alicia anyway. If she had any problems, she'd just have to talk to Bernard.
<P>She glanced over at the clock above the bar. Only a half hour to go. She was tired. She couldn't wait to get home.
<P>Someone sat down in the barstool Alicia had just vacated. Tifa turned around, then stopped suddenly, staring at the shock of red hair covering the head of the man there, not believing what she was seeing, or rather, who.
<P>"What the hell are you doing here?" she blurted out.
<P>Reno looked at her for a moment.
<P>"What?" he said innocently.
<P>"You promised me you wouldn't come here!" Tifa said angrily.
<P>Reno thought that over for a moment, then he shrugged.
<P>"Yeah, so?"
<P>Tifa stared at him.
<P>"Ohh, you are <I>such</I> a jerk," she snapped.
<P>Reno smirked.
<P>"Like I didn't already know your opinion," he muttered.
<P>"What do you want?" Tifa asked.
<P>"Oh I don't know," he replied. He looked past her at the bottles behind her. "A scotch on the rocks would be nice."
<P>Tifa glared at him for a moment, then turned away. She walked away, her shoulders hunched, her eyes smoldering. She should have known. She couldn't believe she had actually believed him when he made that promise. She wanted to kick him in the ass, but, unfortunately, that really wasn't an option. That kind of behavior was frowned upon by her boss, unless Reno did something to deserve it, of course. This was just what she needed, on top of the aggravation of talking to Alicia. She made his drink and slapped it down on the counter in front of him.
<P>"You really should learn to lighten up a little," Reno told her.
<P>"Is there a problem here?"
<P>Tifa turned to see Caraca standing beside her, giving Reno a not particularly friendly look.
<P>"What do you think you could do about it if there was?" Reno asked.
<P>They both stared at one another. Caraca took a step forward, but stopped when he felt Tifa's hand on his arm.
<P>"It's all right," she said.
<P>Caraca turned to look at her.
<P>"You sure?" he questioned.
<P>She nodded.
<P>"Yes," she said. "He's not bothering me."
<P>Caraca stood there for a moment, gave Reno one more nasty look, then walked away.
<P>"Nice gorilla ya got there," Reno commented.	
<P>"Oh shut up," Tifa said impatiently. "He's a very nice guy."
<P>Reno didn't comment on that, instead he looked at her.
<P>"So you really are a bartender."
<P>"Yes, I told you I was," she replied curtly.
<P>"Yeah, but I thought you might be lying," he replied.	
<P>She gave him a look.
<P>"I'm not like you Reno."
<P>He smirked, then lifted his glass and drained about half of it.
<P>"Why did you come here?" she asked.
<P>"Hey, I was curious, okay," he replied. "Is it really that big a deal? It's your own fault you know."
<P>"<I>My</I> fault?" Tifa exclaimed. "How could it be my fault?"
<P>"You're the one who's being so mysterious," he replied. "I have to admit you've made me curious. If you had just answered a few of my questions I wouldn't be here now."
<P>She looked at him skeptically.
<P>"You are unbelievable, you know that? So does that mean if I answer your questions you'll leave?"
<P>"Sure," he replied.
<P>She looked surprised, but then her expression changed to one of suspicion. 
<P>"How do I know you're not lying now?"
<P>He gave her his most disarming smile.
<P>"You catch on fast."
<P>She just shook her head. Why did she even bother?
<P>Reno looked around.
<P>"Nice place you got here."
<P>Tifa didn't deign to answer. She still couldn't believe he had shown up. She could kick herself for letting where she worked slip out in front of him. It was bad enough he nagged her at home, now he was going to hound her here as well? She didn't know if she'd be able to stand that.
<P>She turned away, looking down the bar. Caraca was taking care of the last few customers that wanted to get a final drink in before they closed. She might as well get started on cleaning up. She walked down the counter, picking up the empty bottles along the way. Maybe if she ignored him he'd go away. Yeah, fat chance of that.
<P>She dumped the bottles in the trash then turned to glance back at Reno, hoping maybe he'd take the hint and leave, instead he just held up his empty glass.
<P>She walked over to him and refilled it.
<P>"I don't see what you're so upset about," he told her. "I'm not causing any trouble, now am I? I'm just sitting here minding my own business."
<P>She just glared at him. What he said might be true but she wasn't about to admit it. 
<P>Reno turned to look to one side.
<P>"What's with him?" he said, nodding his head off to the right.
<P>Tifa looked in the direction indicated to see the pale guy who always came in standing against the wall not far away. The man turned away as soon as she looked up.
<P>"You're in his seat," Tifa said.
<P>Reno pondered that for a moment.
<P>"Too bad for him."
<P>Again Tifa did not reply.
<P>"He was staring at you, you know," Reno told her.
<P>Tifa shrugged.
<P>"So?"
<P>"It doesn't bother you?"
<P>"It's a strip joint. Men come in here to stare at women all the time."
<P>"Yeah, but most of them are looking at the girls with their clothes off."
<P>"I don't know," Tifa replied. "Maybe he's got some kind of clothing fetish."
<P>Reno just looked at her for a moment.
<P>"You think?"
<P>"I've seen stranger things."
<P>Reno grinned.
<P>"If that were so, don't you think he'd be better off in a clothing store or something?"
<P>"Not many of them open this time of night," Tifa pointed out.
<P>Reno rested one elbow on the counter.
<P>"Good point."
<P>Tifa looked down the bar again. Most everyone had left, only a few patrons still sat at the bar, hovering over the last of their drinks. 
<P>"Well, I'd love to stand here and chat, but I've got to get things cleaned up so we can go home," Tifa said to Reno.
<P>She walked away without waiting for a response. Reno might have come here, but if he expected her to stand there entertaining him the whole time he was here he was mistaken. She had work to do and she was happy for it. She knew if she stood there chatting with him, he'd <I>never</I> leave.
<P>She cleared the glasses off the bar; setting them on a large tray and taking them back into the kitchen to be washed. As she came out again Delphine walked past her, also carrying a tray. The younger girl stopped and nodded her head toward Reno.	
<P>"Who's that?" she asked.
<P>"His name's Reno," Tifa replied. "He's an old..."
<P>She stopped and shook her head. There it was again. She almost called him an old friend. Why did she keep saying that?
<P>"Just someone I know," she corrected.
<P>Delphine nodded slowly, still looking discretely at Reno.
<P>"He's kinda cute."
<P>Tifa rolled her eyes, then walked out to the bar again, shaking her head as Delphine took her burden into the kitchen.
<P>About fifteen minutes later Bernard came out of the back room, ready to close up shop. 
<P>Tifa looked at Reno, who still sat calmly on the stool as if he had made it his home.
<P>"We're closing up," she said. "Don't you think it's time you left?"
<P>He slid a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it up.
<P>"When are you leaving?" he asked.
<P>"In a few minutes," she replied. "We're all leaving. The place is closing, in case you hadn't noticed."
<P>"Yeah, I noticed. I figured I'd stay til you left and walk you home."
<P>Tifa just stared at him. Where the hell did he ever get the idea that she <I>wanted</I> anyone to walk her home.
<P>"Walk me home? I don't need you to walk me home Reno," she said distastefully.
<P>"Hey, I'm just trying to be a gentleman," he said suavely. "It's late at night, this part of Junon isn't exactly safe, you know."
<P>"Oh please," Tifa shot back. "I've been doing this for over a year Reno, and I've never had any trouble. Well, maybe I have a few times, but I've always been able to handle it. I don't need an escort, especially not you. Who was it who kicked butt in that alley when we first met?"
<P>"They got lucky," Reno replied. "They took me by surprise."
<P>"Sure they did."
<P>"You all set?" 
<P>Tifa looked over and saw Bernard looking at her. All the other patrons were gone, and most of the employees, in fact. Only Bernard, Caraca and Delphine still remained. 
<P>"Yeah, yeah, let's go," Tifa said.
<P>Tifa got her coat and they exited the bar, Caraca still eyeing Reno doubtfully, while Dephine glanced at him with an entirely different look on her face. 
<P>"All right, see you all tomorrow," Bernard said. 
<P>They said their goodbyes. Caraca came up beside Tifa as the others left.
<P>"You gonna be all right?" he asked, pointedly ignoring Reno.
<P>"I'll be fine," she said, giving the bouncer a reassuring smile.
<P>Caraca nodded. He took one last look at Reno, a look that he hoped conveyed the fact that something very bad would happen to the ex-Turk if he messed with Tifa, then turned and walked off, leaving them alone.
<P>Tifa started down the road back to her apartment, Reno walking beside her.
<P>"Reno, go home," she said bluntly.
<P>"Sheesh, chill out, willya," Reno replied. "You knew me a long time ago. Things have changed. What have I done that was so bad lately?"
<P>"You mean beside showing up at the bar when you promised me you wouldn't?"
<P>"Oh come on. It's not that big a deal, is it? I told you I was curious."
<P>Tifa sighed and fell silent. It was true, he hadn't really acted like his old self at all. He hadn't said anything nasty, and he had paid for both her groceries and lunch the other day. 
<P>But did that matter? So what if he had changed, and she wasn't yet ready to concede the fact that he had. Even so, did that make everything okay? Even if he had miraculously suddenly turned into a nice guy, could that wipe away what he had done in the past? Could that make up for the murder of all those people, could it make up for the deaths of Jessie, Biggs and Wedge?
<P>And yet, she wasn't exactly Miss innocence herself, now was she?
<P>She didn't want to think about it. It was all just so confusing. 
<P>She pulled her collar closer around her neck. The night was clear, a half moon shone brightly in the sky to the west. It was cold, but that was nothing more than she expected. She continued on her way, resigned to her fate that Reno was going to tag along no matter what she said.
<P>"So you walk home like this every night?" he asked.
<P>"Yes, I do," she retorted. "What else do you expect me to do?"
<P>It seemed like a dangerous thing for her to do. He knew she could take care of herself, but it was late at night and this wasn't exactly the nicest part of town. It was dangerous enough for a man to walk around here this late at night. It seemed to him she was just asking for trouble.
<P>"Ever think about buying a car?" he suggested.
<P>"I can't afford to buy a car," she replied. "Then I've have to find a place to park it and pay for gas and maintenance. I'm perfectly fine without one."
<P>"I don't know, I think you're just asking for trouble," he replied. "Aren't you worried you're going to end up dead in an alley one day?"
<P>"That's my business," she replied. "What do you care anyway?"
<P>"Why must you be so bitter?" he asked. "We're not enemies any more. And don't give me that crap about what I did with Shinra. That's old news."
<P>"So what?" she snapped. "Does it matter how much time has passed? You did what you did. You killed my friends. What am I supposed to do, just forget about that?"
<P>"Hey, I was just doing my job," he told her.
<P>"Oh, that is such a lame excuse," she retorted. "Just because someone told you to do something doesn't make it right. You have to have to courage to make up your own mind about things, to be able to stand up and say no, that's not right!"
<P>He stopped suddenly and held out his hands.
<P>"So what then? There's no chance of reconciliation here? We all did stupid things back then, now didn't we? You know, I'm really starting to get sick and tired of this attitude. You say you don't want to hang around me but here I am..."
<P>"You're here because you've been following me around all this time, not because <I>I</I> want you here!" she retorted.
<P>"C'mon, we both know this is all just an act. You really want my company, you just don't want to admit it."
<P>"That is <I>so</I> not true."
<P>"It is too."
<P>"Is not!"
<P>They just stood there glaring at each other for a moment.
<P>"Fine," Reno finally said. "If that's what you really think, then look me in the eye and tell me to go. And if you do, then I will, but I don't think you'll be able to do it."
<P>Tifa just looked at him for a moment.
<P>"You mean that? If I tell you to go, you will?"
<P>"Yes," he replied.
<P>She hesitated, staring at him. Was she trying to judge his sincerity? He gave her the most honest and open face that he could manage. 
<P>She stepped up to him. She leaned forward just a bit, so her face was within inches of his.<P>"Go...<I>away</I>!"
<P>She turned and walked quickly down the block.
<P>Reno just stood there for a moment. He had to admit he hadn't expected her to say that, and so adamantly to boot. It hurt his pride a little bit. Not much, but a little. He walked quickly after her until he caught up.
<P>"You don't mean that," he told her.
<P>"Oh good God, what does it take to get rid of you!" she exclaimed.
<P>He just grinned at her.
<P>Tifa looked plaintatively at the sky over her head.
<P>"What have I done to deserve this?" he questioned.
<P>"Oh c'mon it's not that bad is it?" Reno questioned.
<P>Tifa didn't reply, just shook her head. 
<P>She looked up again as a cloud passed over the moon, the darkness surrounding them momentarily. The street they were on was deserted, but she could hear the sound of cars on the main street just a block over. The stars were jagged points of light above her head. The diffuse background light of the city around them prevented her from seeing all but the brightest. She regretted that. She could remember back in Nibelheim, looking up at the sky in her youth, a sky that seemed to literally burst with stars. It had been so beautiful. This paled in comparison.
<P>Still, it was better than Midgar, where she hadn't been able to see the sky at all.
<P>The clouds moved on, and the moons diffuse light illuminated them again. Tifa looked at Reno and saw he had stopped, looking at something behind them.	
<P>"What is it?" she questioned. 
<P>"I thought I saw someone back there," Reno said slowly.
<P>She looked back the way they had come, but she saw nothing out of the ordinary.
<P>"Are you sure?"
<P>"Well, no, not really. I thought I saw someone down at the end of the block, but it might have just been a shadow."
<P>Tifa didn't reply, thinking back to the other night when that man had been following her. Could it be the same person, and if so, what the hell did he want?
<P>"C'mon, let's go," she said. There was no one there now, and there seemed to be no sense in worrying about it.
<P>They turned and walked on. Reno looked at Tifa but she remained silent. He wondered what she was thinking. The momentary distraction seemed to have made her forget that she wanted to get rid of him. Even so she wasn't stupid, she could take care of herself but it was still safer with the two of them together. Maybe she had decided that his presence wasn't all that bad after all.
<P>They reached her apartment a short time later. She stopped at the door and fished in her pocket for her keys.
<P>"What do you say to a quick nightcap before bed?" Reno suggested.
<P>She stopped, looking at him.
<P>"Oh you have got to be kidding!"
<P>"Of course I'm not kidding," he replied. "C'mon, it'll help you relax, and god knows you sure as hell need to."
<P>"I'll be able to relax fine as soon as you go away," she retorted.
<P>"Oh cut it out," he said. "C'mon, I'll even supply the liquor."
<P>He reached inside his coat and pulled out a silver flask.
<P>Tifa just stood there. The man was unbelievable. He was impossible to get rid of. She knew she should refuse. She knew she should just walk in the door and close it behind her. The last thing she wanted was to have in her apartment again.
<P>It wasn't that she would mind some company right now. She was physically tired but not mentally. She probably wasn't going to bed right away anyhow. She could actually use a drink and a little time to unwind, and it would be nice to have someone to talk to. 
<P>But it was <I>Reno</I>!
<P>She pulled open the door. Yes, it was Reno, but as she had to keep reminding herself, he hadn't done anything lately, had actually acted like a decent guy, more or less. She had already told herself she would give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now. Wasn't it about time she started living up to that?
<P>She didn't know. In spite of how he was acting she couldn't just forget what he had done when he worked for Shinra, what he had done to her friends.
<P>Even so she found herself nodding for him to follow.
<P>"I must be losing my mind," she muttered as she walked into the apartment.
<P>Priscilla was sitting on the couch watching television. 
<P>"Everything all right?" Tifa asked as she took off her coat.
<P>"Yup," Priscilla replied. She eyed Reno for a moment, but said nothing about him. "Karisa went to bed around eight. I haven't heard a peep from her since."
<P>"All right," Tifa replied as she pulled out the gil to pay the young gil. "Thanks a lot."
<P>"No problem Miss. Lockheart."
<P>"You should just call me Tifa."
<P>Priscilla nodded but didn't reply. Tifa saw her to the door, then watched her as she quickly walked down the block. She only lived a few houses away. It was a lucky thing too. Tifa couldn't leave Karisa alone, she couldn't escort her babysitter home, and she wouldn't feel right having the young girl wander very far on the streets of Junon this late at night.
<P>When she saw that Priscilla had safely reached her destination she went back inside and closed the door behind her.
<P>Reno had made himself at home on the couch. He took a drink from the flask he had brought, then proffered it to her.
<P>She shook her head. She didn't know what was in the flask, but she had a feeling it was something she wouldn't care for. She didn't really like most hard liquor.
<P>"No thanks, I have my own," she told him.
<P>She walked past him, into the hallway, flicking on the light. She cracked the door to her daughter's room and looked in. Karisa was sleeping peacefully. Tifa went into her own room and changed into a tee shirt with the logo of a prominent sporting goods company on it and a pair of shorts. Feeling much more comfortable, she walked back into the kitchen and took down a bottle of vodka from above the fridge and some orange juice from inside. She set them on the table and mixed herself a drink. She picked up another glass and filled it with ice. The she walked over to the couch and sat down, leaving plenty of space between herself and the ex-Turk. She gave the glass with ice in it to Reno, then she pulled up her knees in front of her, cradling her drink between her hands in her lap.
<P>"So what do you want to talk about?" she questioned. She still couldn't believe she was doing this.
<P>Reno looked at her for a moment.
<P>"I take it that what happened between you and Cloud is not an option?"
<P>"You take it correctly."
<P>Reno gave her an unsatisfied look, but she didn't care. He filled up the glass Tifa had provided from the flask. He took a drink, then looked at her again.
<P>"What are you thinking about?"
<P>She leaned back on the couch, looking away from Reno at the far wall. What was she thinking about? Besides what the hell she was doing sitting her with Reno?
<P>"Do you know how people say they look back on their lives and they wouldn't change a thing?" she asked, turning toward him. "That they have no regrets?"
<P>Reno just looked at her for a moment, then nodded. She was looking at him earnestly with those big brown eyes with just a touch of red in them. He had to admit he had never seen eyes quite like them. 
<P>"They're full of shit," she said, taking a drink from her glass.
<P>Reno eyed her for a moment before taking another sip from his own glass. 
<P>"What have you done that you regret so much?" he asked.
<P>Tifa looked down at her drink, slowly swirling the ice in it.
<P>"It would be easier to list the things that I don't," she responded.
<P>Reno didn't reply for some time, just looked at her. The truth was it rankled him a bit to see her so despondent. He would never admit it, but he thought they were both a lot alike. They'd both been given a raw deal by life. Still, it was her own fault. She didn't have to bear the weight of the world on her shoulders. He had learned long ago that guilt and regret could tear you apart if you let them. She'd be a lot better off if she just let it roll off her like he did.
<P>"I don't regret anything I did," he told her.
<P>She lifted her head and looked at him sharply.
<P>"I rest my case," she said.
<P>He drained his glass and put it down in front of him
<P>"No really," he said.
<P>"You don't regret anything because you just don't think about it," she told him. "Reno, you were a thug and a murderer. You don't regret killing innocent people?"
<P>"I may have killed some people, but none of them were innocent," he replied.
<P>"Bullshit," she said with a vehemence that surprised him. "You dropped the plate on Sector seven, remember? Who knows how many people you killed. You trying to tell me none of them were innocent?"
<P>He calmly poured himself another glass.
<P>"No one in the Sector seven slums was innocent," he replied.
<P>Her nose wrinkled up as she looked at him distastefully.
<P>"How can you be so callous?"
<P>"What do you want me to do? Be like you? Fret over everything that's ever happened to me? Do I have to remind you of how many people were killed when Avalanche destroyed those reactors?"
<P>"I don't deny having been involved in that," she retorted. "That's exactly what I'm talking about, in fact. There are a lot of things I've done that I regret, and that was one of them, but at least I <I>do</I> regret it."
<P>"So what?" he replied. "You think you're feeling bad about it is going to change anything? You think if you feel guilty enough you'll somehow be forgiven? You won't. That's not going to change what happened. It's not going to bring anyone back. You're just banging your head against the wall for no reason. People die all the time. That's just their tough luck."
<P>Her face showed her displeasure.
<P>"Where would we be if everyone had that attitude?"
<P>"Where are we now?" he retorted. "Let me ask you something. You fought against Shinra for some noble goal of saving the planet, right? Well, Shinra's gone, but is the planet saved? Can you look me in the eye and say the world is any better off today than it was when Shinra was running things?"
<P>"Yes," she replied. "It <I>is</I> better off with Shinra gone. The mako reactors are no longer sucking the life out of the planet."
<P>"And instead we're filling the air with coal dust, and the rivers with industrial waste. It may not be as quick but the results will be the same. As long as there are resources out there people are going to exploit them. You knock down one company and there are a dozen more ready to spring up in its place."
<P>"It wouldn't be like that if it wasn't for people like you," she said accusingly. "People who don't give a damn."
<P>"Oh you are so pathetic," he retorted.
<P>Tifa looked at him in surprise.
<P>"I'm pathetic?"
<P>"Yes, you are. I've seen people like you before, and I've seen what happens to them. The only thing people understand around here is strength. You take what you want and crush anyone who stands in your way, whether though sheer physical force or by outsmarting them. That's the way it works. People respect you if you do that. They understand it. They <I>expect</I> it. Compassion is for the weak. You've lived in the slums for most of your life and yet you still don't seem to get that. I don't understand you. What, you think if you actually care about people you'll make the world a better place or something? Is it? Even for you? Frankly I can't see how taking down Shinra improved your lot any. Here you are still living in the slums. You work in a strip joint. The only man you ever loved dumped you."
<P>"Cloud didn't dump me!" she snapped.
<P>He just looked at her for a moment, then leaned back and held out his arms.
<P>"Well, where is he then?"
<P>She just glared at him. God, he was so infuriating!
<P>"Oh that's right," he continued caustically. "I'm sorry, I've touched on the forbidden subject again, haven't I? You can't walk away from me this time. Are you going to throw me out now?"
<P>She glared at him.
<P>"Fuck you Reno."
<P>He just smirked.
<P>"You know, for such a kind and gentle soul you sure have a foul mouth. Has anyone ever told you that?"
<P>She glared at him for a moment, then shrugged her shoulders.
<P>"What can I say, you bring out the best in me," she replied.
<P>"Touché," he responded. 
<P>"I may have helped you in that alley but I'm not as kind hearted as you make me out to be. I'm not some angel, like..."
<P>She hesitated. He looked at her for a long moment.
<P>"Like Aeris?" he suggested slowly.
<P>"Yes," she said sharply. Damn, he'd done it again, divined exactly what she was thinking. Was she that transparent?
<P>"I have my faults and vices just like anyone else, no more and no less. Well, less than some," she continued, eyeing him pointedly. "I'm not as naïve as you think. I work in a strip joint, as you so readily pointed out. They're not exactly dens of innocence."
<P>"Dens of innocence eh? I like that. But that just makes your attitude that much more difficult to understand," he replied. "But anyway, we're getting off the subject."
<P>"Oh, and what exactly is the subject?" she questioned.
<P>"Why, what happened between you and Cloud, of course," he replied.
<P>"That may be the subject in your mind but it's not in mine."
<P>"C'mon, what is the big deal?" he cajoled. 
<P>"Exactly," she replied. "What is the big deal? Why are you so anxious to know? Why should you even care?"
<P>"I don't. I'm just curious, that's all. Haven't you ever been curious about something? It's not like I'm going to run right out and announce your big secret to the world as soon as you tell me. 
<P>"<I>If</I> I do tell you, it'll be when I'm damn good and ready," she stated.
<P>"Fair enough," he said. He looked down at his drink. It was almost empty. He lifted the glass and drained it, putting it back down on the table.
<P>"Are you ready now?" he asked as he poured himself another.
<P>"No," she replied.
<P>He pointed to the glass in her hands.
<P>"You're falling behind."
<P>"I'm in no rush," she said.
<P>"Whassamatter, can't handle your liquor?" he asked.
<P>She looked down at her glass, then at him again.
<P>"Are you challenging me?"
<P>He gave her a long look.
<P>"It might be interesting," he said slowly.
<P>She lifted her glass and drained it, placing it on the table. For a moment she just looked at him, then she pushed it away from herself.	
<P>"I think not," she said.
<P>He was surprised. He had been almost sure she would take up him up on it.
<P>"Not man enough?" he tried.
<P>"It's not a matter of whether I'm man enough. It's a matter of whether I'm stupid enough to let you talk me into something I don't want to do, and I'm not," she stated acerbically.
<P>He lifted his drink again, looked at it for a moment, then shrugged.
<P>"Oh well, it was worth a try."
<P>He sat there for a bit just looking at his glass.
<P>"Okay, if you could live anywhere you wanted to, where would it be?" he then asked.
<P>"Huh?"
<P>"If you had a choice of anywhere to live. Anywhere at all. Where would you pick, and don't tell me it would be here in Junon."
<P>"What kind of question is that?" 
<P>"What's wrong with it?" Reno replied. "You won't let me ask you any <I>good</I> questions. That one seemed harmless enough."
<P>She pulled her knees up closer to her, wrapping her arms around them, pondering.
<P>"Oh I don't know," she said finally. "Icicle Inn, I guess."
<P>"Really?" he said, somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected her to pick there. "Why?"
<P>"I don't know," she said again. "It was nice there. I remember when I was there, that night, with the lights gleaming off the fresh fallen snow. It looked so pretty."
<P>"Pretty cold you mean."
<P>"I don't mind the cold. And the mountains were nice, the snow on the peaks. And it was peaceful there. I guess that's what I really want. Just some peace and quiet."
<P>"So what are you still doing here then?" he asked.
<P>Tifa shrugged her shoulders.
<P>"It's just a dream. I don't expect to actually live there."
<P>"Why not?"
<P>She made a face.
<P>"I don't know anyone there. I wouldn't have a job, or an apartment."
<P>"Minor details," he retorted.
<P>She looked at him for a moment.
<P>"So what, you telling me I should pack up and move to Icicle Inn?"
<P>"Sure, why not?"
<P>"It's not that simple Reno."
<P>"That's what everyone says," Reno replied. "But it's not true. It is simple. You think there are things here that are tying you to this place but there really aren't. You can get a job at Icicle Inn, and a place to live. You'll make new friends. It's not really all that complicated."
<P>She opened her mouth, and then closed it again. She hardly expected this kind of argument from Reno.
<P>"So what are you saying, that I should follow my dreams?" she said. "That's an interesting point of view from a cynic like you."
<P>"Just because I'm a cynic doesn't mean I'm not human too," he replied. "I've had dreams just like anyone else."
<P>"Oh, and what would they be?"
<P>Reno took another drink and leaned back on the couch before replying.
<P>"I don't know. Well, I guess I do. It's kind of weird though."
<P>"Why doesn't that surprise me? It doesn't involve whip cream and an elephant does it?"
<P>Reno blinked.
<P>"No, but if you've got a story like that I'd sure like to hear it."
<P>"Just go on," she told him.
<P>"I've always dreamed about being in this big field," he continued. "A field full of kids."
<P>"Kids?" she said in surprise.
<P>"Uh huh. And the kids are all running around and having fun. And I'm the only adult there. And there's this cliff, and the kids don't pay any attention to it, and if they start to run toward it, it's up to me to stop them, to catch them before they fall off. Like I'm kinda like their protector, you know?"
<P>He stopped suddenly when he saw the way she was looking at him.
<P>"Oh Reno, you are so full of it," she said.
<P>"What?" Reno said.	
<P>She gave him a knowing look.
<P>"I've read that book."
<P>"Hey, it wasn't really... you did?"
<P>Tifa nodded.
<P>"Though I'm kind of surprised to see that you did," she continued.
<P>"Hey, I may be a thug and a murderer, as you so quaintly put it, but I'm not illiterate," Reno informed her.
<P>"And don't forget bullshit artist," she added. "Just like the character, actually, but c'mon, what do you really want?"
<P>Reno thought it over for a moment.
<P>"I have very simple tastes," he replied. "I want to be rich and surrounded by babes."
<P>"Oh that is so shallow!"
<P>"Hey, what's wrong with shallow? There's a lot to be said for shallow you know."
<P>She just shook her head, but she couldn't help but smile. He was surprised at how much it brightened up her face. She certainly hadn't done much smiling in his presence. Not that he cared, of course.
<P>"It's pointless to even attempt to hold a serious conversation with you, isn't it?"
<P>"Well, we can always talk about Cloud."
<P>"No thank you."
<P>They were silent for a moment, then Tifa yawned. She looked over at the clock.
<P>"It's getting late," she stated.
<P>"Late? It's not that late at all," he contradicted.
<P>"Yes it is," she said. "I've got to get some rest. I think it's time for you to go."
<P>"We only just got here," Reno said. "You've only had one drink."
<P>"That's because I stopped," she said. "You've had what, four?"
<P>"It's not polite to count," he replied.
<P>"I have to get up early in the morning," she told him.
<P>"What for? You don't have to go to work until the afternoon, right?"
<P>"Karisa usually has me up by seven," she replied. "And I'm off tomorrow anyway."
<P>Reno made a face.
<P>"Thanks for reminding me why I don't have kids," he said.
<P>Tifa stood up.
<P>"Just a little bit longer," Reno said. "I've almost got the truth out of you, I can feel it."
<P>"Reno..."
<P>"C'mon, just tell me what happened between you and Cloud. Real quick. Then I'll be happy to leave."
<P>"Reno, I don't need this now."
<P>"It'll just take a minute."
<P>"Reno, <I>please</I>."
<P>He looked at her for a moment, wondering if he could push her any farther. Unfortunately it looked to him like she'd reached her limit. He'd just have to try again another time. He had no doubt at all he could get it out of her eventually.
<P>"All right, I'm going," he said glumly.
<P>He stood up. Tifa walked over to the door and opened it up, wrapping her arms around herself from the chill. Reno walked out, then turned to look at her.
<P>"Just real quick..."
<P>The door closed in his face.
<P>He stood there for a moment, then turned away. He looked around slowly, a devilish smile on his lips.
<P>	"She's crazy about me," he said to no one in particular, then started jauntily down the street.
