<H4>CHAPTER VI
<P>THE MEETING<P></H4>
<P>"You don't know who Sephiroth is?  What, did you live in a cave back in Gongaga?"
<P>Zack gave him a look of displeasure.
<P>"Hey, I'm not really much of a news person, okay?"
<P>"Obviously not," Cloud replied. He couldn't believe anyone hadn't heard of Sephiroth, much less someone who aspired to join Soldier. It seemed almost impossible to believe. Zack could hardly read, had never heard of Sephiroth, yet here he was in the Soldier program. It was crazy.
<P>"Why did you join up anyway?" Cloud couldn't help but ask.
<P>"I told you, my whole family thought it was a good idea," Zack replied. "They said I'd be a natural for it."
<P>"But didn't you know anything about the program? Didn't you know what you were getting yourself into?" Cloud questioned.
<P>Zack shrugged.
<P>"Well, not really, I guess," he replied.
<P>"You guess?" Cloud questioned. He couldn't understand Zack at all. Joining the Soldier program was the most important decision he had made in his entire life. It was a huge step and changed everything. He had thought about it for ages, while Zack seemed to have given it no thought at all. "How can you say that? Don't you realize what an important decision it is to join Soldier?"
<P>Zack just shrugged.
<P>Cloud shook his head. He was ready to give up even trying to understand his friend.
<P>They reached the room they first entered the reactor through. Merle was no where to be seen. They tossed their hard hats on the table. Cloud pushed open the door and was greatly relieved to step back out into the alley outside.
<P>"You said everyone in your family thought you would be a natural as a Soldier," Cloud said as they walked down it. "Does that include you?"
<P>"Me?"
<P>"Yeah, you. You see anyone else here? What did you think?" 
<P>Zack shrugged yet again.
<P>"I never really thought about it," he replied.
<P>Cloud did not reply. By this time he thought nothing Zack said would surprise him.
<P>They reached the end of the alley and Zack turned left. Cloud stopped.
<P>"Shinra headquarters is back this way," he said, pointing in the other direction. "Where are you going?"
<P>Zack turned to look back at him.
<P>"I have to meet someone," he said. "C'mon, it won't take long."
<P>"Who, Merle?" Cloud questioned. "I thought you told her you'd see her Friday. Hey, where do you know her from anyway?"
<P>"I met her in a downtown café about a month ago," Zack replied.
<P>"A month ago?" Cloud said, puzzled. It had only been two weeks ago that training had started. "Didn't you just get here?"
<P>Zack walked back over to him.
<P>"No," he replied. "I've been here for almost a year now."
<P>"But.." Cloud began, but then shut his mouth. When Zack had said he was from Gongaga, Cloud had assumed he had arrived here at the same as all the other recruits. "You left Gongaga a year ago?"
<P>"Uh huh," Zack stated. "When my parents finally got some gil, they sent me here. Thought I'd have a better chance at a decent future. But I was too young to join Soldier at that time."
<P>"I see," Cloud replied, not knowing what else to say.
<P>"And it's not Merle I'm going to see," Zack replied. "It's another girl."
<P>"How many girls do you know?" Cloud questioned.
<P>Zack looked at him for a moment.
<P>"You want the whole list?" he asked.
<P>Cloud shook his head. He had a feeling that would take longer than they had.
<P>"Where do you have to meet her?" he sighed.
<P>"Sector five."
<P>"Sector five? Down below the plate?"
<P>"That would be where it is, yes," Zack replied.
<P>Cloud looked at his watch.
<P>"It's seven thirty," he said. "Curfew is at nine. Can we make it in time?"
<P>Zack placed his hands on his hips.
<P>"Do you have to worry about <I>everything</I>? C'mon, it won't take long."
<P>But Cloud shook his head. He had almost had a heart attack when Sephiroth had discovered them in the reactor. That was more than enough trauma for him for one day. Enough was enough.
<P>"I don't know about you, but I think I've already pushed my luck as far as it can go for one day," he said. "I'm going back."
<P>Zack looked at him unhappily.
<P>"It's not going to take long," he tried again.
<P>Cloud wasn't in the mood to argue.
<P>"I'll see you back at the dorm," he said. "Nine o'clock. Don't forget."
<P>"Yes mother," Zack replied. 
<P>Cloud gave him a look.
<P>"All right, I'll see you then," Zack said more seriously. "Too bad, I think you two would like each other."
<P>Cloud shrugged.
<P>"Some other time."
<P>Zack nodded.
<P>"All right then. Later."
<P>"Yeah, later."
<P>Zack walked quickly down the block. He turned to look back when he reached the corner, but Cloud was already gone. Zack continued on his way, whistling absently. It had turned out to be a pretty good day. Even though he didn't feel very confident about the upcoming test, at least now he had someone who was going to try to help him. And they had gotten to see the mako infusion. That had been cool.
<P>Cloud seemed like a pretty nice guy, though a bit closed mouth and kind of a worrywort. Still, there was something about him that made Zack trust him. He certainly wouldn't have trusted just anyone with his little reading problem.
<P>He made his way quickly to the train station. In spite of what he had told Cloud, he wasn't sure if he had enough time to get back before nine. But he wasn't worried about it. If he didn't make it in time, he was sure he'd be able to sneak back in somehow.
<P>It took about twenty minutes for the train to wind it's way down to the lower plate. It was darker down here, since the plate blocked out what little light remained, making it seem even later than it was. Zack quickly walked the few blocks it took to get to his destination. Finally he stopped in front of a cozy looking two story cottage and looked up at the brightly lit second floor windows.
<P>He looked around for a moment, then stooped down and picked up a small rock. Aiming for the wall of the cottage just to the side of one window he cocked his arm back. But he stopped when he suddenly saw movement in the room above. A  young girl appeared in the window. She pulled it open. Resting her arms on the sill, she looked down at him.
<P>"You're late."
<P>Zack smiled crookedly.
<P>"I know," he replied. "I got tied up with my studies. Can you come down?"
<P>"You know Elmyra doesn't want me going out at night," Aeris replied. 
<P>Zack was well aware of how strict Elmyra was with her daughter. 
<P>"Yes, I know," he replied. "But tell her we won't go anywhere. We'll just stay right out front."
<P>Aeris hesitated a moment, then nodded.
<P>"Okay, I'll try," she said, and disappeared from the window.
<P>Zack waited, looking up and down the road, but no one else was around. He walked over to a split rail fence that ran along the road opposite Aeris' house and sat down. He didn't have to wait long before the front door of the house opened and Aeris stepped out. Pulling on a sweater against the night chill, she walked over to him.
<P>"I can't stay long," she said as Zack stood up.
<P>"S'okay. I have to get back soon too," he said.
<P>"So how have you been?" Aeris queried. "How is Soldier training?"
<P>Zack shrugged.
<P>"It's been pretty interesting. Hey, you ever heard of someone named Sephiroth?"
<P>Aeris looked slightly puzzled.
<P>"General Sephiroth?"
<P>"Geez, has everyone heard of this guy but me?" Zack said petulantly.
<P>"I'm surprised you haven't heard of him," Aeris said slowly, still wondering why Zack had asked. "He famous, and he is a general in Soldier."
<P>"Yeah, well, you know I never pay attention to that sort of stuff," Zack said. 
<P>Aeris waited for him to say more, but nothing was forthcoming.
<P>"Why do you ask?" she said finally.
<P>"I met him today," Zack replied.
<P>Again he seemed to need prompting for more details.
<P>"And..." she prodded.
<P>"And nothing, really," Zack said. He repeated to Aeris what had happened at the reactor.
<P>"You and a friend snuck in?" Aeris said when he was done. "Do you really think that was a good idea? You could have gotten in big trouble."
<P>"But we didn't, now did we?" Zack replied with a grin.
<P>Aeris sighed. She had had conversations like this before with Zack. Was he ever going to grow up?
<P>"You know, someday you're going to get into more trouble than your charming personality can get you out of," she predicted.
<P>"We'll see about that," he said, obviously not convinced. "It's always worked so far."
<P>She nodded. It was true. She had never met someone quite like Zack. He seemed to go through life with no thought of the future, no thought of what might happen tomorrow. He seemed to think that no matter what he did, everything would all work out somehow. It was one the things that had attracted her to him, yet at times it could be infuriating.
<P>"What are we going to do with you?" she questioned, shaking her head.
<P>He just shrugged.
<P>"So how are you?" he questioned. "I haven't seen you in a while."
<P>"I know," she responded. "Since you started your training. I've missed you."	
<P>"Well, I told you I wouldn't be able to see you as much once this started," he replied. 
<P>"Uh huh. You've probably already met a dozen beautiful girls on the upper plate," she said. "By the time you're done you'll have forgotten all about me."
<P>"Hey, I'd never forget you," he replied. "Sure, I have met a lot of girls, but none of them turn my head. You're the one I'm always thinking about."
<P>"Somehow I doubt that," she said. 
<P>He looked at her for a moment, but the smile on her face told him she wasn't being serious.
<P>"Yeah, well, how do you think I feel?" he responded. "Leaving a beautiful girl like you alone with all the wolves down here below the plate? I'm surprised someone hasn't snatched you up already."
<P>"There's no one around here that interests me," Aeris said truthfully.
<P>"Good," Zack replied.
<P>She smiled and moved closer to him, trying to steal a little warmth. He obliged her by putting his arm around her. Even though it was still summer, the temperature dropped quickly here in Midgar once the sun had gone down. Fall was rapidly approaching and a chill was in the air. 
<P>They were silent for a few moments before she spoke again.
<P>"So this mako infusion thing didn't look very pleasant?" she questioned.
<P>Zack shook his head.
<P>"It didn't look like anyone had any fun, that's for sure," he confirmed.
<P>"Do you think it's safe?" she said slowly.
<P>He looked down at her.
<P>"What do you mean?"
<P>"I don't know," she replied. "It obviously has a very unpleasant effect on people. If it does that to you outwardly, who knows what other effect it might have."
<P>"It just increases your strength," Zack reassured her.
<P>"Are you sure?" she replied. "I mean, I know it does that, but is that all? How can you be sure it doesn't have some detrimental effects as well?"
<P>"Like what?"
<P>"I have no idea," Aeris replied. "I'm not a scientist."
<P>"Exactly," Zack agreed. "Shinra has scientists working on this, and they say it's safe. They've been doing it for  years. Don't you think we'd have heard something by now if there were any ill effects? They wouldn't do it if it wasn't safe."
<P>Aeris looked far from convinced.
<P>"I don't know. I just don't trust Shinra."
<P>She had known Zack for over six months now, but she had not told him about what happened to her and her mother, or how Shinra was still after her. It wasn't something she really wanted to dwell on.
<P>It was funny, all her classmates, everyone she knew in sector five she kept at arm's length. Yet somehow, Zack had managed to slip behind her shield, had somehow managed to draw her out. She wasn't sure quite how he did it, but he seemed to have that effect on everyone. Somehow his buoyant nature and infectious enthusiasm made it easy to confide in him, made him someone she felt like she could trust. The very first time she had met him she knew there was something different about him.
<P>Even so they weren't really that close. He had a place in Sector Four, on the upper plate, but she had never been there. They had gone out a few times, but nothing that was really planned. Even before he had joined Soldier, she never knew when he was going to show up. When she was in an optimistic mood, she considered him her boyfriend, but she wasn't sure whether the term really fit. They had only kissed once, and had never really talked about their relationship. Whenever she tried, he almost managed to change the subject. He didn't seem committed to anything in life, much less one girl. She had a strong suspicion that in spite of what he had told her earlier, there were plenty of other girls in his life. Since they weren't all that serious, this really didn't bother her that much. Maybe someday, that would change.
<P>"You still there?"
<P>She looked up, realizing she had been lost in thought.
<P>"Sorry," she apologized. "I'm just worried about you, that's all."
<P>"You don't have to worry about me," he replied. 
<P>"So you've told me," she replied. "But someone has to."
<P>"You're going to keep me out of trouble?"
<P>"I don't think anyone can do that," she replied. "Let's just say, I'll try to make sure you get into less trouble."
<P>Zack smiled and gave her a squeeze. 
<P>"You know me too well."
<P>Aeris did not reply. She knew so much about him, and so little. But then again, there was a lot he didn't know about her. She had told him she was an Ancient, but just like everything else, it hadn't really seemed to matter to him. He hadn't asked any questions at all, and when she had tried to explain it anyway, he hadn't seemed to care. For better or worse, he seemed to look at her as just an ordinary girl, so she had dropped the subject. Maybe that was another reason she liked him so much. Even the people at school who she considered friends still seemed to treat her a little bit differently than everyone else.
<P>She wondered what Zack would think if he saw her use her newfound 'powers'. Maybe that was something he's actually take notice of.
<P>A movement down the street caught her eye. At first, she thought it was just the wind stirring up some debris in the road. But as she looked, the dark shape she saw resolved itself into the outline of a man walking slowly toward them. He stopped then, just at the edge of a revealing pool of illumination cast by a streetlight. Though he remained shrouded in darkness, Aeris was quite certain who it was.
<P>"I have to go."
<P>Zack looked only slightly surprised.
<P>"So soon?"
<P>"It's getting late," Aeris replied. "I'm not really supposed to be out at all. If I don't go in now, Elmyra will be out here dragging me in any minute."
<P>Zack didn't seem to think that was much of a threat.
<P>"We're right in front of the house..." Zack protested.
<P>"Zack," he admonished.
<P>"Yeah, all right, all right," he gave in. "I gotta be getting back anyway."
<P>She slid out from under his arm.
<P>"I'll see you again soon?" she questioned.
<P>"I'll see what I can do," he replied noncomittingly.
<P>She glanced down the road again. Tseng hadn't moved.
<P>"All right. Bye."
<P>She stepped forward and gave him a peck on the cheek. He didn't say anything. She turned and walked slowly back to the house. She turned again when she got to the door. Zack was walking down the road in the opposite direction from Tseng. She already could barely make him out.
<P>She opened the door, but she was interrupted before she could walk in.
<P>"Aeris."
<P>She turned to see Tseng walking rapidly toward her. She turned away from him.
<P>"I have nothing to say to you," she said.
<P>"Aeris. Wait."
<P>She stepped across the threshold.
<P>"Please."
<P>She stopped, then turned around slowly to face him. She wasn't even sure why she was doing it. She didn't want to talk to Tseng. She didn't want to ever see him again.
<P>"Make it quick," she said.
<P>"I'm sorry."
<P>If anything, that got her attention. She had never expected to hear those words from Tseng. She looked him over, trying to hide her surprise.
<P>"Perhaps...perhaps I was a little harsh with you," he continued. "But I want you to believe me. I know that you're not going to be happy like this, Aeris. I know you want to know more about your heritage, and I know Shinra can help you do that."
<P>"I know, I know Shinra hasn't been kind to you," he continued before she could say anything. "But things have changed. If you come in with me, I'll make sure no one hurts you. You have my word on it."
<P>Aeris just stood there. She didn't know what to think out this latest outburst. After practically forcing her to hate him, now he comes back suddenly contrite, as if it was all a mistake? As if she was just supposed to forget the fact that he'd shot and nearly killed some woman for no good reason at all?
<P>The strange part was, he sounded so sincere. She had known Tseng for years, she thought she had a pretty good idea of who he was. He was a Turk, in fact he was the definition of a Turk. He thought about nothing else. In all the years she had known him he had never pressured her, until their last meeting that is, but he had never struck her as being a kind person either. Everything he did, he did for his own purposes. To advance his own agenda.
<P>So why didn't she feel like that now? Why did she feel that, no matter how he might have felt in the past, what he was saying now was the truth?
<P>She leaned against the doorframe, rubbing her hands idly together.
<P>No, not the truth. Not quite. To Tseng maybe it was. But Tseng didn't run Shinra. He might think he could protect her, but could he really? It seemed to her that for some reason, Hojo got whatever he wanted from Shinra, and if he wanted her, how could Tseng be so sure he could prevent that?
<P>But more than that, what could have brought about this change? He had seemed to be perfectly willing to play hardball just a few days ago. But now this? She knew he wasn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart. There had to be some reason. Something had happened to make him change his tactics. She probably would never know what had caused that, but it seemed, whatever it was, it was to her advantage.
<P>"I'll make sure they don't tear down the church," Tseng continued. "There are plenty of other places. I'm not going to pressure you. Take your time and make up your own mind. But please think about it. It really is the best thing for you."
<P>Still she didn't reply, not sure how to respond. Did he really think this sudden change in attitude was going to convince her? Did he really think it would make her anything but more suspicious?
<P>He glanced down the darkened road for a moment.
<P>"Who was that you were with anyway?"
<P>The question immediately brought Aeris suspicions back to the forefront. She had tried to plan her meetings with Zack so they took place when Tseng was not around. The Turk didn't really keep a by the clock schedule. She never really knew when he was going to show up. Nevertheless, after all these years, she had noticed there were certain times when Tseng was unlikely to show up. So far they had been lucky, but Zack had been late today.
<P>"Just someone I know from school," she replied. "He needed to get a homework assignment."
<P>Tseng looked at her for a moment, while she tried to keep her face as neutral as possible. She was never sure just how much Tseng could tell from her expression. 
<P>Of course, she couldn't tell what he was thinking, but he seemed to accept her explanation.
<P>"Anyway, like I said, just think about it. Can you do that?"
<P>Their conversation was suddenly interrupted as Elmyra walked into the room behind them.
<P>"Aeris, I think you've been out..."
<P>She stopped when she saw Tseng outlined in the doorway, her features darkening.
<P>Aeris glanced at Elmyra, then back at Tseng.
<P>"I have to go."
<P>Tseng nodded.
<P>"I won't keep you," he said.
<P>With a nod to Elmyra, he spun around and walked into the darkness. He was quite a distance down the road when he heard the door finally close.
<P>He walked on at a slow steady pace. The night air was cool and refreshing. Most people walked warily through the slums of Midgar at night, but Tseng had no such qualms. Everyone in Midgar knew the significance of his blue suit and even hardened criminals would not dare to attack a Turk. The fact was, he enjoyed strolling at night. He liked the quiet solitude. It helped him think.
<P>And he had a lot to think about. Here he had just decided to show Aeris that Shinra meant business, that he wanted her back at Shinra and would  play hardball to get her there, and Sephiroth had to come along and say he didn't want her found just yet. Talk about bad timing...
<P>He didn't think she believed what he had just told her. At least, not yet. He had never tried that kind of conciliatory tactic before. He had mostly said it to throw her off guard, to add a new wrinkle to their little game. She wasn't an easy person to fool. He wasn't sure, but there were times when he was almost certain she could tell what he was feeling. Perhaps another one of her Cetra abilities. So he had always tried to be as sincere as possible with her. He had had to lie to her on occasion, but he'd always tried to say it in terms that even he could believe might not be a lie at all. Sometimes it was quite a tightrope to walk. He had been telling the truth when he said if she returned he would protect her. Or at least try to. Whether he actually could, however, was another matter entirely.
<P>No, she wouldn't fall for that so quickly. But she was a good person, and deep down inside she would want to give him the benefit of the doubt. It would take time, but he could nurture that. Even if it didn't get her to come back to Shinra with him, it might eventually convince her that he meant her no harm, that they might even be able to become friends someday. Who knows, that might have unexpected benefits. If Sephiroth ever was going to go up against Shinra, Tseng had no illusions about what kind of war he could end up caught in the middle of. In that position, he could use all the friends he could get. Perhaps, if he played it right, the Cetra might end up being his ace card in the hole.
<P>He lifted his eyes to look down the road ahead of him. There was no one to be seen.
<P>Still, he would have to be careful. Aeris wasn't above lying herself. He hadn't seen who she was with when he approached, but it was no kid from her school. He knew a Soldier trainee uniform well enough, even in the dark. She was seeing someone, someone she didn't want him to know about.
<P>He wondered for a moment if it had been one of Sephiroth's spies. After all, he was the leader of Soldier, everyone in the program adored him. Was Sephiroth using some new recruit to keep tabs on the girl himself, and possibly Tseng as well?
<P>Too many questions, and not enough answers. If it had been a spy of Sephiroth, there wasn't much he could do about it except keep his eyes open and watch his back. But that didn't bother him much. After all, it was a game he had been playing ever since he joined the Turks, and was one he was damn good at.
<HR>
<P>"So how do you think you did?" Cloud whispered.
<P>"I think I blew it," Zack replied.
<P>"Blew it? After all that studying we did?"
<P>"Hey, there was a lot there that we didn't go over," Zack responded. "They didn't word the questions the way they were in the book. I don't know. It's kind of hard to say."
<P>"Do you have something to say, Mr. Tigana?" Sgt. Zu barked.
<P>"No sir!" Zack shouted.
<P>The Sergeant walked over and started at Zack for a moment. The recruits stood at attention in front of him in the center of a large gymnasium. They had just gotten out of the military history test.  
<P>"This exercise is called The Big Sting." Sgt. Zu continued, satisfied that he had their attention once again. "You will each be issued a special shirt."
<P>Zack leaned over to Cloud.
<P>"Big sting? They couldn't think of anything better than that?"
<P>"Shush," Cloud muttered, seeing the Sartgeant glancing their way.
<P>Sgt. Zu walked over to a nearby table covered with the afformentioned garment. He picked one up. It was gray with dark blue metallic strips running down it in vertical stripes. He held it up for them to view for a moment, the dropped it back on the table.
<P>"You will also be issued a weapon."
<P>On the floor beside the table was a pile of what was obviously their weapon. The Sergeant picked one of these up. It was a long rod, over six feet in length. One end of it bulged out, covered in thick padding. Holding it in both hands, the Sergeant swung it in the air.
<P>"This is called a Stinger Stick," he explained. "It can be used to knock a person over. There is also a sensor in the padded tip. If it comes in contact with the shirt..."
<P>He lifted it up, then thrust it forward into the pile of shirts. There was an audible crackling sound.
<P>"Whoever is wearing the shirt will get a bit of a jolt," he continued. "If you haven't been knocked down already, it will put you down. When that happens, you are out of the competition."
<P>He replaced the weapon back in the pile and walked back to the table. He picked up another object. It looked like a large red ring, bigger than his hand. "There are thirty of these rings placed throughout the floor. Your objective in this exercise is to collect as many of these rings as you can. There are special pockets to hold them in the shirts. The entire floor is your battlefield. You receive the most points for collecting rings, but you also receive points the longer you survive. The exercise ends an hour after it starts. The other instructors and I will be monitoring your progress on the cameras. In addition there will be monitors in most of the halls. These people will be wearing red shirts. If you have any questions, you can ask them. Whatever ruling they make is final."
<P>He put down the ring and looked at them all.
<P>"Is that clear to everyone?"
<P>"Yes sir!" a number of them shouted.
<P>"Very well," the Sergeant replied. "Each of you come forward, put on a shirt and get a weapon."
<P>The students filed forward. Cloud took one of the shirts and slipped it on. The metal strips made it feel heavier than it appeared. Then he picked up one of the weapons. It was taller than he was, and he held it awkwardly, wondering what the best technique was to use it. He had never used anything like this before, but then again, neither had any of the others.
<P>"You will each be starting at a different point on the floor," the Sergeant said when they were all equipped. I and the other instructors will escort you to your starting points. Wait there until you hear the announcement that the exercise has begun. Any questions?"
<P>He looked around. No one responded.
<P>"Very well, let's go."
<P>They split into three groups, the Sergeant and two of the other instructors leading them away. Zack and Cloud, along with five other students, followed Sergeant Zu. They walked quickly through the corridors. Every so often the Sergeant would stop and tell one of the students to remain. After three had been dropped off, the Sergeant told Cloud to stay.
<P>Zack looked back and winked at him as the Sergeant led him off. A moment later they turned the corner and Cloud was alone.
<P>He had kept his eye out for any rings as they had been walking, but he hadn't seen any. He supposed the Sergeant had taken him along this route just to avoid them. But even so that was a small hint. He knew there weren't any down the path they had followed. He racked his brain, trying to remember the layout of this floor. He knew the dorm and surrounding areas well, since that's where he spent most of his time. But there were other areas of the floor where he rarely went. Fortunately, he was pretty good with maps, and had been curious enough about his surroundings to have looked at a few, as well as wandered around on the floor occasionally in his spare time. He had a feeling he had a better idea of the layout of the place than most of the students. Hopefully, that would work to his advantage.
<P>He wondered how far away he was from Zack. It seemed to him that they would have more of an advantage working as a team. At least, in the beginning. After they had weeded out the competition, then they could think about themselves. The Sergeant had made no mention of that. He had seemed to indicate it was every man for himself, but he hadn't expressly forbidden it either. But in order to do anything, he would have to find Zack first.
<P>He wasn't sure how long he stood there, but it didn't seem that long before a loudspeaker crackled over his head.
<P>"Students of the Soldier program, begin exercise Big Sting."
<P>He ran down the corridor, heading in the direction he had seen the Sergeant and Zack go. He turned randomly, looking for any rings as much as he was looking for Zack. He swung around another turn and saw one of the students at the next intersection. The boy glanced at him, then turned and disappeared around the corner. Apparently he wasn't anxious for a fight.
<P>Which made sense, Cloud supposed. Attacking everyone he saw might get rid of the competition, but it also might slow you down enough that the others will get to the rings long before you. It would be different if there was a ring to be contested, but there was no sense in fighting over nothing. Besides, the Sergeant had told them they'd get points for lasting long too, so why take the chance on being out of the competition right away?
<P>Or at least, that seemed to make sense to him.
<P>He came around another turn, and heard the sounds of battle ahead of him.
<P>He ran down the hall to an open doorway. Looking in he saw two of the other students fighting in what looked like a conference room. On a table in the center of the room was one of the rings.
<P>As he stepped in the room one of the boys lunged for the other. The second boy dodged out of the way. He used his weapon to bat the other's aside, then drove his forward. There was a crackling sound and the boy who was hit fell back. 
<P>The winner turned to glance at Cloud, then turned again and leaped at the ring on the table, obviously trying to grab it before Cloud could. Cloud ran forward, but he saw the other boy was going to reach it before him. In desperation he lunged forward with his weapon. The boy grabbed the ring, but his own lunge left him defenseless. Cloud's weapon touched his shirt, and he jerked back and collapsed to the floor.
<P>Cloud spun around without pausing and dashed from the room. He'd missed out on the ring, but he'd taken the other kid out. He didn't have any rings yet, but at least he was still in the hunt.
<P>As it turned out, his first ring didn't require a battle. It was hanging from the wall along an empty corridor. He quickly snatched it up.
<P>His second one wasn't so easy. As he was wandering past the cafeteria he glanced inside and saw a ring on one of the tables. He was making his way toward it when a second boy stepped into the room from another entrance. This was one of the boys he saw often in class, though they didn't talk to one another. His name was Monroe.
<P>This time Cloud was the one who was closer, but he wasn't going to make the same mistake the boy in the other room had made. Instead of trying to grab the ring, he stood his ground in front of it.
<P>Monroe jabbed at him with his weapon. Cloud dodged to the side, giving the boy an unimpeded line to the ring, hoping he'd go for it, only this time Cloud would get him before he reached it. 
<P>But his adversary didn't take the bait. Instead he spun around and lunged at Cloud again. Cloud dodged backward, crashing into a table and falling over. The boy came at him again. With catilike reflexes Cloud kicked a chair into his path, giving himself enough time to spring to his feet again. He lunged forward  himself, his weapon narrowly missing the other boy. Monroe brought his weapon around, smacking Cloud solidly in the face with it. Cloud fell over once again.
<P>The boy tried to hit Cloud's shirt while he was down, but Cloud spun  on the floor and the weapon hit his leg instead. Cloud twisted his leg and it wound up around his opponents weapon. Monroe tried to pull it away, but at the same time Cloud brought his own weapon around and hit the boy in the chest.
<P>Monroe jerked backward then stumbled to the ground himself.
<P>"Bastard!" he cried out.
<P>Cloud sprung up. He'd done it! He'd won! He turned around and grabbed the ring off the table.
<P>"You got lucky, Strife!' Monore snapped. But Cloud didn't care, he wasn't paying attention to Monroe anymore. Ring safely tucked away, he ran from the room.
<P>As he made his way down the hall, flushed in triumph, the overhead speakers blared again.
<P>"Ten minutes remaining. Five rings still unclaimed in the northwestern portion of the floor."
<P>He turned left at the next intersection, headed in the direction suggested. Perhaps it was some kind of trick, perhaps not. He figured he had nothing to lose by investigating.
<P>He ran as fast as he could. Ten minutes wasn't a lot of time. He only had two rings. He was sure some of the others must have done better.
<P>Eventually he turned a corner and entered a large storage room. Once again he heard the sounds of battle in front of him. He made his way down a narrow corridor between two storage shelves, then came out into a wide open area. Shelves lined one wall. A row of crates ran along the other. Above three of the crates, Cloud could see rings hanging from the wall. To the left of the crates was where the fighting was taking place. Four or five boys were in battle there. 
<P>None of them noticed Cloud. He looked over at the rings. The closest one was just across the room from him, much closer than the battlers.
<P>He ran across the room. Glancing over at the battle, he saw that one boy was trapped in a corner, with the others apparently working together against him. Even as he watched, one of the weapons struck the lone boys shirt, knocking him down.
<P>Cloud wasn't far away from them now. He reached the crate and hauled himself  up, even as one of the boys spotted him with a cry. He pulled himself onto the crate, grabbed the ring and shoved it into his pocket, then turned as the others rushed at him.
<P>He jumped to the side as one of the one of the boys weapons jabbed at him. He swung his own weapon, forcing them back for a moment, but then they pressed forward again. They were obviously working as a team. A good idea, if one could find someone to team up with. He wasn't sure how the four of them planned on splitting two rings, but he suspected they wouldn't worry about that until he was out of the way.
<P>He didn't have any illusions about his ability to defeat four opponents. He knew he didn't have a chance. The only reason they hadn't overwhelmed him immediately was because of his height advantage. The crate was a good five feet off the ground. They couldn't get up on it without climbing, and anyone climbing up would be easy prey. His attacks were aimed at their heads and shoulders, where he could easily hit their shirts. Theirs mostly at his legs, which wasn't going to score them any points. But even as he desperately held them off, he knew he couldn't last for long.
<P>Not without help anyway, and as it happened, help was just around the corner.
<P>He wasn't sure exactly where Zack came from. He was way too busy trying to dodge his opponents blows. His adversary's must not have known either, for the first hint anyone had that he was there was when his weapons struck one of the boys squarely in the back, taking him out of the action.
<P>One of the others cried out a warning, swinging his weapon at Zack. At the same moment Cloud's weapon swung, catching the boy in the side of the head. He stumbled and nearly fell. He didn't until a moment later, when Zacks weapon hit him right in the chest. 
<P>The other two turned toward Zack, moving away from the crate, intent suddenly upon survival instead of attack. Cloud jumped down from the crate to stand beside his friend. Even as he did so, one of their opponents turned and ran. The second boy, suddenly realizing he was alone, turned and shouted something. 
<P>Immediately Cloud drove his weapon forward, and was rewarded as it struck the boys shirt.
<P>"Oww. Dammit!" the boy shouted as he spun around and stumbled to the ground.
<P>He was still looking at his companion, who had dropped his own weapon and thrown himself on top of the crate. He got up, grabbed hold of the ring, then leaped toward the other crate.
<P>"Shit!" Cloud exclaimed as he and Zack ran forward. It didn't look like they were close enough to stop the boy from getting the last ring.
<P>The boy jumped up onto the last crate. Zack suddenly skidded to a halt. He lifted up his weapon, balanced like a javelin in his hand, and launched it into the air.
<P>Just as the boy made a grab for the ring, it struck him cleanly in the back.
<P>There was a crackling sound, and the boy fell over, bouncing off the crate and landing on the floor with a crash.
<P>Cloud stopped and turned to look at Zack.
<P>"Nice shot."
<P>Zack nodded. Their heads slowly turned until their eyes came to rest on the last ring.
<P>Their heads turned again, until they were looking at one another once more. For a moment, they just stood there.
<P>Then, at the same instant, they both bolted for the last ring.
<P>Cloud was slightly ahead, but he knew Zack was faster. He reached the crate first, but Zack was right behind him. Dropping his weapon he threw himself on top of the crate. His fingers reached out, but just as he was about to grab the ring, something heavy landed right on top of him, pushing him downward. Another hand reached out, and snatched the ring nearly right out of his grasp.
<P>He turned his head to see the ring in Zack's hand.
<P>"You suck!"
<P>Zack grinned at him.
<P>"Gotta be faster than that!" he said.
<P>The both pulled themselves to their feet.
<P>"Exercise Big Sting is now complete," the disembodied voice above them announced. "All students return to the gymnasium to hand in your equipment. Scores will be posted in the morning."
<P>They jumped down off the crate and started back toward the gym.
<P>"So how many rings did you get?" Cloud questioned.
<P>Zack reached into his pocket and fished around for a moment.
<P>"Six," he replied.
<P>"Damn," Cloud said slowly.
<P>"You?"
<P>"Only three," Cloud replied.
<P>"I bet that's still better than a lot of the others," Zack said encouragingly.
<P>The four boys they had defeated were in the corridor ahead of them, talking among themselves. Occasionally they would glance back and look at Zack and Cloud darkly, then start talking among themselves again.
<P>"Looks like they weren't too happy with what we did to them," Cloud said quietly to Zack. "Think we've made some enemies?"
<P>Zack just shrugged. 
<P>"We beat them fair and square," he replied. "What were we supposed to do, let them win?"
<P>Cloud shoved his hands into his pockets. Zack was right. They hadn't done anything unfair. This is what the program was all about, the best rising to the top. He reminded himself again that he hadn't come here to make friends. They had been beaten, and if they didn't like it, tough luck.
