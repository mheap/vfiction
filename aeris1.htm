History: Aeris was born in the town of Icicle Inn. She is the daughter of Proffessor Gast and the Cetra, Infalna. Aeris never got to know her father, for when she was only twenty days old Hojo, who was looking for Cetra to use in his twisted experiments for Shinra, killed her father and took Aeris and her mother to Shinra headquarters in Midgar.How long they remained there is uncertain, but Infalna eventually managed to escape with her young daughter. Unfortunately the damage done to Infalna by Hojo's experiments was too much for her, and she only got as far as the Midgar train station before she collapsed. Knowing that she was dying, and with no other choice, Infalna entrusted her daughter to the first woman she saw who appeared sympathetic. <P>
Whether she knew it or not, Infalna made a good choice. Elmyra was a very loving woman and raised Aeris as if she were her own.<P>
Being the daughter of one of the Ancients, Aeris was a rather unusual child. From the very begining Elmyra noticed that she acted much more mature than her age would suggest. Although Elmyra tried to treat Aeris like any other child, her ability to talk with the planet and know things that people did not made it difficult sometimes. Elmyra realized early on that there were just some things about this child that she would never understand, and Aeris often did things that left Elmyra wondering what would become of her.<P>
Aeris had some friends as a child, but no one she was really close to, and didn't seem all that interested in spending much time with other children, even when Elmyra encouraged her to. Still, Aeris seemed happy enough, so Elmyra did not push it.<P>
As Aeris grew from a child into a beautiful young women other unusual powers began to manifest themselves. She seemed to have limited abilities to heal others, in spirit as well as body. She also seemed to have a special affinity to plants, and even those withered and near dead would spring quickly back to life if she turned her attention toward them. In her early teens she found an old abandoned church where some wild flowers were growing in the sparse soil. She soon turned it into a thriving garden that became her favorite place to spend time, and was the lone bright spot of the entire sector. She soon became know as the Midgar flower girl, and people came from all over the city to buy her flowers.<P>
As beautiful as Aeris was, it was inevitable that she would eventually attract the attention of the many boys growing up in the area. Aeris politely rebuffed them all, and for a long time Elmyra thought she wasn't going to show any interest at all in them, but then Elmyra noticed that Aeris did seem to be spending a lot of time with one particular young man by the name of Zack.<P>
Zack struck Elmyra as a fine young man, and she encouraged their relationship. But they were stll quite young, and it hadn't developed very far when Zack decided, like so many other young men at the time, to enroll in Shinra's SOLDIER program.<P>
Aeris did not see much of Zack once he joined SOLDIER. His training for the elite group was intense, and he rarely got leave. Even after he had completed training he was often out on assignment, but he did manage to keep in touch. He sent her a letter a short time before he went out on an assignment to investigate an incident at a reactor out near the small town of Nibelheim, but afterwards she never heard from him again.<P>
Since her escape, Aeris life had not been troubled by Shinra, but Hojo never gave up his attempts to find the young Ancient and continue his experiments. Eventually he got wind of the unusual flower girl in sector five and sent the Turks to investigate.<P>
Aeris became aware that the Turks were searching for her and took refuge in the only place she felt safe, her old church. It was here, just prior to Reno and his henchman arriving, that Cloud Strife literally dropped into her life.<P>
