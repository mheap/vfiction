History:Cait Sith was created by Proffessor Gast for the amusement of his newborn daughter, Aeris, and the other children of Icicle Inn. He was a combination of robot and an actual stuffed toy that was animated by a special type of materia. Though the final product was impressive and it appeared to be a promising line of research, Proffessor Gast did not pursue the technology any further. He had many other projects he was working on which he considered much more important. He thought of  Cait as nothing more than an amusing novelty. 
<P>Shortly after Aeris was born Proffessor Gast was killed by Hojo. His lab was stripped down and most of his work, including Cait,  was sent off   to Midgar for futher study if it seemed warrented. 
In Midgar Cait was stored away and soon forgotten. It was almost ten years later that he was discovered by a young Shinra executive name Reeve.
<P>Reeve, who had always had an interest in unusual things, was intrigued by Cait. Athough he was no scientist, by studying Proffessor Gast's notes, he soon learned how to control Cait.  
<P>Even to Reeve, Cait was nothing more than an interesting hobby. As he rose in the company he continued to play with Cait's controls in his spare time. Using a computer and radio transmitter in Shinra headquaters, he found he could control Cait from great distances.
<P>Eventually Reeve's ability to control Cait came to the attention of his bosses at Shinra, and Tseng decided that this toy could be useful after all. He ordered Reeve to use Cait to spy on people suspected of working against the company. Since he was employed by Shinra and Cait was their property, he could hardly refuse.
<P>But Reeve did not like to use Cait this way. He was honestly concerned about the welfare of the people of Midgar, and thought Shinra was good for the city. Up to now he had been a loyal company man, and was quickly climbing the executive ladder, but this started him thinking about the company, and for the first time he found himself questioning their actions.
<P>It was soon after this that he started to hear rumors about a rebel group called AVALANCHE.
<P>At first no one at Shinra seemed much concerned, but after reactors one and five were destroyed by the rebel group the company was in an uproar. They became desperate to find this group and snuff it out. Cait was employed to help in the search for them, but did not come into contact with them at this time. Instead, Tseng found out from other sources that the rebel headquaters was somewhere in the sector seven slums.
<P>Not sure of the exact location, and desperate to eliminate them, President Shinra ordered the supports above sector seven to be taken out, which would bring the upper plate crashing down on the sector, destroying it completely. Reeve was horrified by this. The loss of life that would occur would be much greater than had happened when the reactors were destroyed, and as far as he was concerned this made them worse than the rebels,  but when he protested he was ignored.
<P>By now Reeve was disgusted with the company, but he had come to realize that Shinra was not going to let him just walk away. As one of the top executives at Shinra, he was involved whether he liked it or not
<P>It was soon discovered that some of the AVALANCHE members had escaped the destruction of Sector Seven. They were soon captured when they attempted to rescue Aeris, but they escaped when an even greater danger appeared. Sephiroth returned and killed President Shinra.
<P>Rufus quickly took command and sent the Turks after Sephiroth. But he had not forgotton about Avalanche. He had Tseng kidnap Marlene, Barret's young daughter, to use as a bargaining chip if it becomes necessary. 
<P>Again Reeve was not happy with this turn of events, but Rufus appeared to be even more ruthless than his father, and Reeve harboured no doubts what would happen to him should he protest. Rufus learned that both Sephiroth and the remaining members of Avalanche were heading west, and when he ordered Reeve to send Cait to the Gold Saucer on the chance that he might find them, Reeve realized he has little choice but to go along.
<P>Reeve had seen a lot of good in Shinra in the early years, and he still hoped, perhaps foolishly, that the company could somehow right itself. In spite of all that had happened he still felt a little guilty at his thoughts of betraying Shinra. But he couldn't make believe that the things they had done had not happened. So it was that Reeve harboured deep conflicting emotions about his task when Cait finally met up with the memebers of Avalanche soon after.
