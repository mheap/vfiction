<H4>CHAPTER II
<P>THE FLOWER GIRL<P></H4>
<P><I>What's wrong with me?</I>
<P>The young girl sat on the steps outside a broken down church, her knees pulled up just below her chin. Hidden here below the upper plate, the girl couldn't see the sun, but the fast fading of what little light filtered down here told her it was dusk. She lifted her eyes, staring up into the darkness, and the huge metal framework that supported the plate above her head, above all their heads. The bottom of the plate was high above them, yet she could almost feel the weight of it, pressing down on her, on all of them, a psychological burden felt by everyone who lived here.
<P>Her eyes drifted back down to the streets in front of her. The streets weren't as crowded as they had been earlier. Most people had already made their way home from work, and were safely ensconced in their homes by now, feet propped up watching tv, which seemed to be the main pastime of the working class of Sector Five, or perhaps sitting down at the dinner table. That thought reminded the girl that she probably should be getting home herself. It wasn't safe to be out after dark, and her mother would be worried.
<P>But she didn't move. It wasn't quite dark yet, and she didn't feel like going anywhere.
<P>Even though the streets were quiet, they weren't completely deserted. There were always some people on the streets, going about their business. A group of men walked briskly past her, one of them looking her up and down as he strolled by.  She didn't seem to notice.  They  walked on, turning into a popular pub just down the street. A couple walked slowly down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the road, and a group of girls stood at the corner chatting among themselves.
<P>There were five of them, about her own age. She recognized some of them from school. A couple of them had glanced at her earlier, but that was the only acknowledgement they had given her. They didn't inviter her over, nor did she make any attempt to join them herself. They had their own little clique, one she was not a part of.
<P>And so it seemed for all the people she knew. Every one of the girls in school had friends, had people they hung out with, had fun together with. Everyone had their own little group.
<P>Everyone but her.
<P><I>She's not human.</I>
<P>She'd heard the whispers. She'd seen the way some of her classmates looked at her. She had never hidden the fact of her Cetra heritage. She had always acknowledged that she was different.
<P>But sometimes it was hard for her to grasp just <I>how</I> different.
<P>Of course, they weren't all like that. There were some people at school who talked to her, who were pleasant, who didn't treat her any different from anyone else. There were even some who had given her an open invitation to be friends, to be part of her own little group.
<P>Yet she had always declined.
<P>She didn't have any real friends, but it wasn't because everyone shunned her, it was because she herself held back. She was pleasant, she was polite, she held up her end of conversations, but she only let others get so close and no closer. She never let anyone in, never let anyone see the real her. She always kept everyone at arm's length.
<P>And she didn't even know why.
<P>She looked at the girls talking on the corner, and felt like she was missing out on something. What would it be like to have a real friend? It seemed like it would be fun to have someone you could confide in, someone you could trade secrets with. And yet, everytime she tried to open up something stopped her. It wasn't that she didn't <I>want</I> to have friends. It was more like something inside her, some part of her that might not even really be her, grabbed her in an invisible grip everytime she tried to become friendly with someone and shouted at her; 'That is not for you.'
<P>Was that what it was to be a Cetra?
<P><I>She's a freak. Always talking to things that can't be seen. It's not normal!</I>
<P>She had learned early on that no one else could hear what she could. No one else could hear the planet, could speak to it, could understand it. None of them, especially the kids at school, could even vaguely grasp the concept. It was a shame, really, that none of them could hear what she heard. The sound of the planet when it was in harmony was the most comforting thing she had ever felt. When she had been held captive by Shinra, when her real mother had died, the comforting music of the planet had played a large role in helping her through those harrowing experiences.
<P>Perhaps that was one reason she didn't feel the need to have close friends. Perhaps the fact that the others couldn't hear the planet, couldn't feel that comfort, that they clung to one another so closely. Just as she was sure they couldn't truly understand the voice of the planet without hearing it, so she couldn't really imagine living a life without it. Perhaps she needed to experience what it was like to truly be alone before she could form a real bond with any of her friends.
<P>Or perhaps it was her experiences that made her different. Most of her classmates had grown up here in Sector Five. They went to school, came home. Played, talked, watched tv, did homework. She was fairly certain that none of them had been held captive by some lunatic scientist for years. And though some of them had lost a parent, she wasn't sure any of them had had their father murdered when they were just an infant, nor seen their mothered tortured and finally die in front of their eyes in one last ditch effort to escape the same said scientist. 
<P>She sat with her classmates all day. Ate at the same table as many of them during lunch. Even though she was not close friends with any of them, she had listened to enough conversations to know that the main topic among them was boys, clothes and more boys. For some reason, after all she had been through, those particular topics of conversation didn't hold much interest for her.
<P>A movement caught her attention, dragging her out of her thoughts. A short way down the street a man in a blue suit was slowly approaching.
<P><I>Whenever she's around, the Turks don't seem to be far away. They're bad news. You better stay away from her. Something's going on and if the Turks are involved, it can't be good. When they show up, people die.</I>
<P>The young girl's foot stirred restlessly on the step. She was tempted to get up and walk away before he got here, but he had already seen her, probably long before she had seen him.
<P>She sat there staring at the road in front of her until he stopped a few paces away.
<P>"Hello Aeris."
<P>She turned toward him. Long black hair hung down almost to his shoulders, a shape contrast to his pale complexion.
<P>"Tseng,' she said slowly.
<P>His small black eyes peered at her. Dark quixotic eyes. She had heard terrible rumors about the Turks. Thieves, extortionists, murderers. She also knew that they worked for Shinra, the very same company that Hojo, the scientist who had killed both her parents worked for. She also knew that Hojo was still looking for her. Tseng had already asked her a number of times to come back with him to Shinra. She hadn't wanted to, and had told him so the first time she had seen him, and everytime after. She knew that the Turks were ruthless, and she felt the ruthlessness in this man as well. Yet, for all that, he had never tried to force her to come with him. She had no doubt that it was well within his power to do so, and there wouldn't be much anyone could do about it. Her mother could not protect her from the Turks, and everyone in the sector, perhaps in all of Midgar, were deathly afraid of them. If he forced her to go with him, she knew there wasn't much she could do about it. Yet, for all this time, he had never done that. For some reason he didn't seem to want to force her, seemed to want her to go back voluntarily. She didn't understand it, but one thing she did know was that she would never voluntarily return to her parents murderer. No matter what he said, he wasn't going to talk her into going back. If he wanted her to go back, he would have no choice but to use force.
<P>He seemed to realize this. Yet even knowing that fact didn't seem to keep him from trying to talk her into it.
<P>"How have you been?"
<P>That was the way he always talked to her. Like they were old friends. She wasn't sure when he had first showed up at Elmyra's house. She remembered the actual event like it was yesterday, but she wasn't exactly sure how old she had been. But it wasn't long, no more than a year after she and her mother had escaped. She had been what, about seven years old? She wasn't sure, she had been just a child. Still, she would never forget the frightened look on Elmyra's face. And when Aeris had stood up to Tseng and told him in no uncertain terms that she would not go with him, well, in spite of the humor in seeing a sever year old girl stand up to a Turk, all the color had drained out of Elmyra's face, as if she had expected Tseng to just grab her right then and there and be done with it. And the truth was, from the impression she got from him then, (and still did) it seemed likely he would do just that.
<P>But much to their surprise, he hadn't. Instead he had just talked to her, told her how special she was, how she had a gift and should share it with the world. 
<P>And eight years later, it hadn't changed. He was still talking to her. Still trying to convince her. After all these years, you'd think that he would have taken the hint and realized she was never going to be convinced. A normal person would have given up by now, or failing that, taken her by force. But the Turks were not ordinary people, and whatever else could be said about him, neither was Hojo. Whatever plan they had, they obviously had a great deal of patience. She was beginning to wonder if she was going to have to put up with this for the rest of her life.
<P>Maybe that was the plan. Just make her so sick of being pestered that eventually she would give in, like some kind of twisted water torture. The simplest things could drive one batty, if it seemed never ending. Either that or, for some reason, they needed her to come along willingly. As if whatever they had in mind wouldn't work without her full cooperation.
<P>Eight years. She had to admit that was a long time. Having known him that long, was it any wonder he talked to her like a friend?
<P>"I'm fine," she replied. After all this time, her voice still held a guarded tone. In all the time she had known him, Tseng had never threatened her. He had always acted like a perfect gentleman. If she didn't know better, she would have thought him a kind and gentle man.
<P>But she did know better.
<P>Even if she hadn't heard any of the rumors. She could <I>feel</I> it.
<P>The man beside her was dangerous and dark and deadly. The heart that beat in his chest was cold as ice. 
<P>He brushed the dust off the step beside her and eased himself down. His dark blue suit was immaculate, and obviously expensive. There were a few well off people in Sector Five, but not many. Most everyone who had any gil, or acquired any, moved up to the upper plate. You didn't see many people in Sector Five dressed as well.
<P>"Shinra is thinking of building a recycling plant down here," he said.
<P>Aeris did not reply. It seemed to be an odd way to start a conversation.
<P>"Yeah, this place is getting a little run down, and they'll like to spruce it up a bit," he continued. "You know, show the people who grateful they are for their business, and all that crap."
<P>He looked away from her, down the street.
<P>"They're scouting out areas to build it. They even told me to keep my eyes open for a likely place."
<P>Aeris kept her face blank. She had no idea where he was going with this, but she had a feeling she'd find out soon enough.
<P>He shifted his body, swinging his head around to look at the church whose steps they were sitting on.
<P>"They need a central location," he said slowly. "Not too far from the center of the sector. You know, it would probably fit very well right where this church is. There's enough land, and it's not like anyone ever comes here anymore."
<P>Aeris eyes widened.
<P>"The church," she said slowly.
<P>"Yeah," he said, turning to look at her. "This old broken down church. No one uses it. It's falling apart. It would be easy to tear down. Wouldn't even cost much and the place would look a helluva lot better, don't you think?"
<P>Aeris frowned. It hadn't taken him long at all to get the point after all. The church was Aeris refuge. Her home away from home. The only place she felt safe, the only place in Midgar where flowers would grow. And Tseng knew that as well as anyone.
<P>"But you won't let that happen if...if I come with you," she said slowly.
<P>Tseng just looked at her for a moment, then nodded.
<P>"You catch on fast."
<P>Aeris face flushed with anger. This was the first time he had ever done something like this. He had always talked to her, always told her how much more she could do at Shinra, how much more she could learn about herself. He had always used the carrot. This was the first time she had seen the stick. She should have known it would come to this one day.
<P>"That's cruel of you Tseng," she finally said. She couldn't think of anything else to say. She made it sound like an accusation, as if that admonishment would make him realize that he wasn't being nice. As if being nice ever mattered to a Turk.
<P>Yet when he replied, she was surprised to hear an almost conciliatory tone.
<P>"Does it really surprise you that much?" he asked. "We've been very patient with you Aeris. I've tried to convince you to come voluntarily, but it seems my pleas are falling on deaf ears. I'm sure you realize that I could take you against your will, and there isn't a damn thing anyone here would do to stop me."
<P>Aeris hesitated. That was the closest thing to a threat Tseng had ever said to her.
<P>"So why don't you?" she asked finally. "Why have you been so patient?"
<P>This time it was Tseng's turn to hesitate. Through all these years she had never asked him so direct a question.
<P>"We can have patience when we need to," he replied slowly. "In spite of what you may have heard about us, we don't take whatever we want whenever we want. Even the Turks know that cooperation is often better than taking things by force. If we can come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial there's no need for trouble."
<P>He leaned forward, looking at her intensely.
<P>"You're alone Aeris. You're lost and alone. You not like these people. You don't belong here."
<P>Aeris face paled slightly. It was as if Tseng had snatched those very thoughts from her head. But she recovered quickly.
<P>"And you think I do belong with Shinra. The people who killed my parents," she said.
<P>Tseng shook his head.
<P>"A regrettable incident," he replied. "Hojo can be a little headstrong at times. He did that without orders. But it was a long time ago Aeris. Yes, Hojo is still with the company, but they've kept a close eye on him since then to make sure he remains in line. It probably doesn't mean much, but on behalf of Shinra I apologize for his actions."
<P>Aeris looked at him. Seemed he was just full of surprises today. That was another thing he had never done before. She had to admit it had an effect. After all this time, it was nice to see someone actually express some remorse for what had happened to her parents. But the real question was, was that remorse sincere, or was it just another ploy?
<P>"An apology would carry more weight if it was issued by Hojo himself," she said slowly.
<P>She observed him closely for a reaction when she said this, but his face kept it's usual impassive look. In spite of her ability to vaguely feel other people's emotions, she could never tell quite what Tseng was thinking.
<P>"If it will make you come with me," he replied finally, "I'll see that it is arranged."
<P>Aeris paused. Did he really mean that? She couldn't help but wonder exactly what he was up to. It was obvious Shinra wanted her. But just how badly? Obviously, if they were pursuing her for this long, they must want her pretty bad. Bad enough to tell her anything they thought she wanted to hear? Was this the truth, or just some sort of trick. It wasn't like it was an unreasonable demand. If all it took to get her to come along was an apology from Hojo, wouldn't Shinra be willing to do that. She didn't think Hojo would issue one voluntarily, but he had a boss there to. They could order him to do it.
<P>But that wasn't the important question. The important question was, was that enough to get her to cooperate? Was that all it would take, an apology from Hojo, to get her to go along? 
<P>Shinra was a big company, but even big companies change. Could what Tseng was telling her be true? Could it be that Hojo was acting without orders when he killed her father. Even if that were true, she couldn't believe that she and her mother had been kept captive for all those years without Shinra executives knowing about it, especially since they had been at Shinra headquarters the whole time. It just didn't make sense.
<P>No, there was more to it than just Hojo's actions. Shinra was up to something. She didn't have any proof, but she knew it in her heart. Her instincts told her she couldn't trust Shinra, and she always followed her instincts.
<P>"What is it they want from me anyway?" she questioned.
<P>"I've told you that before," Tseng replied. "To help you realize your potential."
<P>Aeris made a sour face. She didn't remember much about what had happened to her in captivity. She had been too young, and besides that, the memories had been too painful. She had tried to forget what little she did remember. But one phrase had remained with her. One phrase that she had heard, over and over.
<P>The promised land.
<P>"But what does that <I>mean</I>?" she questioned.
<P>Tseng shifted uncomfortably. The concrete of the steps had a tendency to dig into the skin after a while.
<P>"It's not something I can explain," he replied. "It's something you have to see for yourself. You're growing up. You're not a little girl anymore. Your powers are getting stronger.  But they are unfocused, and you're not going to understand them, much less be able to control them. You need someone to teach you. Ordinarily that would have been another Cetra, but, unfortunately, there aren't anymore left."
<P>"Thanks to Shinra," she reminded him, not being able to keep the bitterness out of her voice.
<P>"Yes, that's true," Tseng admitted. "But you can't let what Shinra did in the past ruin your life. We're not talking about Shinra anymore, I'm talking about you Aeris. I know you're not happy, and you're never going to be unless you learn what it means to be a Cetra. You're not going to learn that in Sector Five. You know that as well as I do. Shinra has a store of knowledge about the Cetra, more than anyone else. Whether you like it or not, we're the only one's who can help you."
<P>Aeris bowed her head. She didn't know what to think anymore. Was that Tseng's intention? Tseng was right, she wasn't happy here in Sector Five. Deep down inside she did want to know more about herself, more about her Cetra heritage. She couldn't deny, as well, that Shinra knew more about the Cetra than anyone else. A knowledge they had gleaned, she thought with bitter irony, from her own mother before they had killed her. 
<P>No, there was no doubt that Shinra had more knowledge of the Cetra than anyone else in Midgar. But Midgar wasn't the whole world. Who knew what else was out there? Who knew what knowledge there was stored away in other cities, on other continents. She had heard that Cosmo Canyon was a storehouse of learning. Maybe they had knowledge of the Cetra too, perhaps even as much as Shinra. 
<P>But Cosmo Canyon was far away, and her prospects of getting there anytime soon didn't look particularly bright.
<P>Even so, that didn't mean she couldn't get there someday. And even if she didn't find anything there, there were still other places. It was a wide world, and Midgar was only a small part of it, though at the moment it seemed to be her whole life. Perhaps...perhaps if she searched hard and long, she might even find another Cetra, another one of her own kind out there. How could they really be sure there weren't others left?
<P>It wasn't impossible.
<P>But it wasn't very likely either. It could very well be that there are no others. It could very well be that everything Tseng was telling her was true, that Shinra was her only chance to discover her heritage.
<P>She just didn't know.
<P>It all came down to whether she trusted them or not. Even though Tseng has seemed nice enough to her, even though what they had done had been long ago, Hojo was still there, and the President of the company was the same person. But she did want to find out about herself. She wanted to know what they knew. Would it be possible for her to go along until she found out what she wanted to know, yet still thwart them if they had evil intentions?
<P>She sighed to herself. She was only fifteen. She was no good at lying or deceit. Pretending to go along would be a very dangerous game, a game she was not used to playing. She didn't think she could match wits with them in that regard.
<P>Was it true what he said? That she had powers? What powers, she couldn't help but think. It was not the first time he had referred to this, but she didn't know what he was talking about. Was he referring to her ability to talk to the planet? As far as she knew that was the only thing she could do that others couldn't. Well, that and a talent for making plants grow, but she didn't think Shinra was interested in her for her green thumb. But the impression she got was he wasn't talking about her speaking to the planet either. But if not that, then what?
<P>Well, as long as they were being so direct.
<P>"What powers? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any powers. Except for being part Cetra, I'm just an ordinary girl."
<P>Tseng shook his head.
<P>"No, you're far from ordinary. You know that, though you may not be willing to admit it."
<P>Aeris frowned. She was so sick of all these riddles. She wished he'd just come out and tell her what they really wanted her for.
<P>"I know I'm different, but not in any way that would be useful to anyone," she insisted. "I know you're not talking about my ability to speak to the planet. Did it ever occur to you that maybe Shinra is making a mistake? That I don't have whatever it is they're looking for? Both my mother and I were held captive by Hojo for a long time. Don't you think if I had any 'powers' he'd have discovered them? Perhaps all these years of hounding me have just been a huge waste of time."
<P>"You were too young then," Tseng replied. 
<P>"Well, what about my mother? Did she have these so called powers?"
<P>"Yes of course. All Cetra do, to a certain extent."
<P>"Then why didn't Hojo get what he wanted from her?" she asked. "Why would he need me?"
<P>Tsengs eyes drifted up to the plate above them.
<P>"She wouldn't cooperate," he replied. "She fought Hojo every step of the way. He tried to force her, of course, but your mother was a strong woman. She wouldn't give in, even when he hurt you."
<P>Aeris paled. Unbidden memories forced their way into her mind. Lying on a table, needles jabbed uncaringly into her arms, a pain like white hot fire flowing through her veins. She remembered her screams, and the sound of her mothers voice, close enough to hear, but too far away to help. She'd never forget the agonizing sound of it.
<P>"Eventually he resorted to torturing her, but even then she didn't give in," Tseng continued, as if talking about a local sporting event and not someone's life. "But he went too far, and the damage he did to her ended up killing her."
<P>But not before we escaped, Aeris thought.
<P>Her mother had given her life to get Aeris from Shinra, and now Tseng was expecting her to voluntarily return?
<P>"My mother was a Cetra, but I'm half human," she pointed out. "Maybe I don't have any of these so called powers."
<P>Tseng sighed.
<P>"Still trying to convince me we're wasting our time eh?"
<P>He looked around them for a moment.
<P>"Perhaps what we need here is a little demonstration."
<P>With that he stood up. Aeris looked at him curiously, but he was not looking at her, instead he seemed to be scanning the other people on the street. For a moment, his eyes locked on the girls who were still stood down at the corner. The girls who Aeris knew from school, but then his gaze shifted, until it fell on a woman pushing a stroller on the other side of the street.
<P>"She should do."
<P>Something in the way he said it made Aeris nervous. She got to her feet.
<P>"What are you going to do?" she asked.
<P>He didn't reply. Instead she saw his hand reach into his suit. When it came out a moment later it held a gun.
<P>"Tseng," Aeris said in an alarmed voice. She knew he carried a gun. All Turks did. But she had never seen him take it out before.
<P>He ignored her. He lifted the gun and pointed it at the woman.
<P>"Tseng, no!"
<P>The sound of the retort was so loud it made her ears ring.
<P>Heads turned. One of the girls down at the corner cried out.
<P>But Aeris didn't see that. She was running toward the woman, who now lay still on the ground. She couldn't believe it. She couldn't believe Tseng had just shot her for no reason. After all this time she had been begining to believe he wasn't as bad as all the talk made him out to be. How could he do such a thing?
<P>She was alive. As Aeris fell to her knees beside her, she saw the woman's eyes were open. But that didn't mean she would remain in that condition. She was grimacing in pain, and a pool of crimson was forming on the ground beneath her. She tried to lift herself up when she saw Aeris, but then fell back with a cry of pain.
<P>"Don't move," Aeris shouted, not able to keep the hysteria from her voice.
<P>"My baby," the woman moaned.
<P>Aeris glanced up. The stroller stood right beside the woman. Aeris could see inside. The baby appeared unhurt.
<P>"He's okay," Aeris said. "Lie still, I'll try to stop the bleeding."
<P>She had been shot in the chest. Her blouse was soaked with blood. She was gasping for air. The bullet had penetrated a lung, though Aeris did not know that. She didn't know any first aid, but she did know that applying pressure would help stop the loss of blood. Even so, the woman was going to need more help than that.
<P>She pressed her hands against the wound, at the same time looking up. A man had been on the street, but he was nowhere to be seen now. Aeris turned to look down at the corner, just in time to see the girls that were there running down the block away from them. The only other person around was Tseng, who was nonchalantly walking toward her.
<P>"She needs help," Aeris cried out. "She needs an ambulance. She needs someone to call for help."
<P>Tseng kept walking at the same leisurely pace until he stood right beside her.
<P>"There's no one here to help her but you, Aeris," he said.
<P>Aeris looked down to see her hands were red with blood as well now. The woman's eyes were no longer open.
<P>"She's going to die!" she shouted.
<P>"So save her," Tseng replied.
<P>"<I>How</I>?" Aeris shouted. What did he expect her to do? She wasn't a doctor. She didn't have any restore materia, not that she would know how to use it anyway. The only materia she had was the white one her mother had given her, and that was useless.
<P>Tseng just looked at her.
<P>A surge of anger welled up inside her. What the hell did he want? What the hell was wrong with him? Was he really just going to stand there and watch this woman die right in front of him?
<P>Of course he would. He was the one who had shot her, after all. Did she really expect him to help?
<P>"Bastard!" she snapped.
<P>"Calling me names is not going to help her," Tseng replied calmly.
<P>There was no point in arguing with him about it. He wasn't going to help, that was obvious. She looked away from him. They were in a residential area. She didn't see anyone outside. She didn't know which houses might be occupied, which ones she could go to to call for help. 
<P>The woman no longer seemed to be conscious. She seemed to be struggling for every breath she took. Aeris was afraid to move her hands, afraid to take pressure off the wound, but she didn't think she was doing enough. She had to get help, but would the woman bleed to death before she could get back?
<P>"Concentrate," Tseng said.	
<P>Aeris didn't even look at him.
<P>"On what?"
<P>"On what you want to achieve," Tseng replied. 
<P>She was getting sick of listening to him. What the hell was he babbling about? 
<P>"Why don't you just shut up!" she said, surprised by her own vehemence.
<P>"Clear your mind," he said, seemingly unfazed by her outburst.
<P>The woman groaned. Aeris looked at her desperately. She had to do something, and she had to do it now. She might still have time to run to a phone.
<P>But something inside her told her not to.
<P>Instead she closed her eyes. 
<P>Clear your mind. Concentrate. Tseng's words drifted around in her head. Her heart was thudding in her chest. She didn't want this woman to die. 
<P>She tried to calm herself. Panic wasn't going to do anyone any good. She had to think. She had to...concentrate.
<P>Slowly, slowly she felt her heart begin to beat slower. 
<P>Why was she doing this?
<P>Concentrate. Concentrate on what?
<P>On what you want to achieve.
<P>What did she want to achieve? She didn't want the woman to die. She wanted it to have never happened. She wanted to heal her.
<P>Deep inside the pit of the stomach, Aeris felt a warmth building up in her.
<P>What is that?
<P>Concentrate.
<P>She wanted the woman to live. She wanted her wounds to heal. She couldn't die. 
<P>So what do you think you can do about it?
<P>This is stupid.
<P>The warmth started to fade.
<P>She pushed those thoughts out of her head. 
<P>Stupid or not, this might be the woman's only chance.
<P>Healing. Concentrate on healing...
<P>The warmth grew, more quickly now, rising up from her stomach. It felt good.
<P>The strands of her hair began to stir.
<P>Live. I want you to live!
<P>The warmth suddenly expanded, filling her whole body, bathing her in it's warm glow. She had never felt anything like it. It felt good. So good...
<P>At the same time the breeze that wafted through her hair suddenly became stronger, whipping the loose strands of hair about her head, and at the same time filling her with a strange elation.
<P>And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it was gone. The wind faded away and the warmth died out, leaving only a faintly pleasing sense of comfort.
<P>Aeris opened her eyes.
<P>The woman was concious. She was looking around as if she didn't know what had happened. 
<P>Aeris lifter her hands from the wound.
<P>But there was no wound.
<P>Aeris hands slowly fell to her sides.
<P>"What...what happened," the woman said slowly, looking down at her blood soaked blouse. "I...I was shot...I..."
<P>"Go home."
<P>Tseng's words cut through the air harshly.
<P>The woman looked at them both for a moment. Then, without another word she turned away. Taking hold of the stroller, she hurried off down the street.
<P>Aeris turned to look at Tseng furiously.
<P>"You used me!"
<P>Tseng shrugged.	
<P>"You wanted proof you have powers," he replied. "Now you know."
<P>Aeris just stood there. She wanted to take Tseng and throttle him. How could he have done such a thing? How could he have risked so much?
<P>"How did you know I could do that?" she snapped.
<P>"I didn't," Tseng replied. "For sure."
<P>Aeris turned away. It was just as she thought. He hadn't known for sure. If it hadn't worked that woman would have died. Tseng had been willing to take someone's life just on the chance she could stop it. It was true what she had been told about the Turks. It was all true.
<P>"I hate you," she said. It was not a phrase she used lightly. She had never said that before to anyone in her life.
<P>He was right beside her. She took a step away. She didn't want to be anywhere near him.
<P>"It doesn't matter how you feel about me," he replied. "I'm not asking you to do this for me. I'm asking you to do it for yourself. You have powers. I just proved it to you. Wouldn't you like to know more about them? Wouldn't you like to be able to control them? Wouldn't you like to know exactly what you can do? Shinra can teach you all that, and more. You're not going to learn that here in Sector Five. We've been patient with you, but we're not going to wait forever. Shinra knows how to apply pressure to get what it wants, more than you know. I wasn't kidding about the church. And that's just the begining. You have to realize that your actions don't affect just you, but everyone around you. Today it was a stranger, but tomorrow it might be someone you know and love."
<P>She suddenly swung around towards him.
<P>"What do you mean?" she snapped. Was he talking about threatening Elmyra?
<P>"I think you know," he replied. "You're not a kid anymore. You're got to learn that you are responsible for your actions, and you're not the only one who might suffer from your making the wrong choices. Shinra always gets what they want, Aeris, one way or another. You can make it easy on yourself, or you can make it hard. It's entirely up to you."
<P>She just stood there looking at him. Finally he had revealed his true self, and it was even worse than she had suspected.
<P>"Go to hell," she snapped, then turned and walked away as fast as her feet could take her.
