<H4>CHAPTER II</H4>
<P>Reno awoke to the smell of fresh brewed coffee and the sound of something sizzling on the stove. He opened his eyes, blinking for a moment at the strong sunlight entering the room through the open curtains. 
<P>He lifted his head, then groaned softly. His neck was stiff as hell and his back felt like someone had taken strips out of it, leaving raw, irritated skin.  
<P>He could see Tifa standing in the kitchen, hovering over the stove with her back to him. Karisa was sitting amongst her toys on the floor right in front of him. His movement must have caught her attention, for she was looking up at him with curious blue eyes.
<P>"Hello," she said. "My name's Karisa. What's yours?"
<P>Reno just looked at her for a moment. A thought came to him, a thought he couldn't resist acting upon. "I'm..." he thrust his chin forward and glared at her, "...the boogie man!" he hissed.
<P>Her smile instantly disappeared, turning into a look of fright as if a switch had been flipped. She pulled herself to her feet, scrambling away from him. Bursting into tears she ran into the kitchen.
<P>"Mooommmmmyyyyyy!"
<P>Tifa spun around instantly at this stricken call. Karisa ran up to her and wrapped her arms around her mothers leg, wailing. Tifa looked down at her for a moment, a looked of shocked surprise on her face, but then she suddenly lifted her head to pin Reno with her gaze, her expression turning from one of shock to a withering stare.
<P>"What did you do?" she demanded.
<P>Reno shook his head.
<P>"I..uhh..." he stammered. In spite of the fact that Tifa was about to kill him, he had a hard time keeping a straight face. He had hardly expected that strong a reaction!
<P>Tifa peeled Karisa off her leg and took a step toward him, holding her cooking spoon in front of her as if it were a lethal weapon, which, in her hands, it could very well be.
<P>"What did you <I>do</I>?" she repeated.
<P>Reno suspected that even his not inconsiderable skill at fabrication wasn't going to get him out of this one.
<P>"I...I told her I was the boogie man," he admitted, still trying to keep himself from laughing.
<P>Tifa was not amused.
<P>"You asshole!"
<P>"It was just a joke!"
<P>"Oh, I'm sure it was hilarious!" she snapped acidly. "You think it's funny scaring little kids? Is that how you get your kicks these days, Reno?"
<P>"Mommy said a bad word."
<P>Tifa turned to look at Karisa, who was standing behind her now. She was still crying, but wasn't hysterical any longer.
<P>Tifa put the spoon down on the kitchen table and scooped her daughter up into her arms.
<P>"I know," she said. "I'm sorry. Mommy's under a lot of stress. He was just joking." She gave Reno a glare. "He's not the boogie man honey, he's just a big moron."
<P>Winding her slender arms around Tifa's neck, Karisa gave him a look from under the protective safety of her mother's hair.  It was mistrustful, but curious as well.  Children, unlike adults, were usually very forgiving.  He figured Karisa would forget by breakfast if Tifa let her.
<P>Giving Reno her back, Tifa struggled to hold onto what was left of her temper.  He shredded it every chance he got, as if his sole mission was to cause her discomfort.  In that respect, he hadn't changed much.  She knew 
she shouldn't have brought him here.  She should have let him limp his way 
home.  Whatever happened in the alley, knowing Reno's mouth, he had likely 
deserved it.
<P>Sighing beneath her breath, she glanced down at her daughter, reminding herself that no one deserved to be beaten half to death.  Reno could just use a few strategically placed slugs...
<P>Already, Karisa's hold on her was lessening.  A relief, because it left her free to make breakfast, but alarming as well, because children, regardless of most circumstance, were so trusting.  You couldn't protect them enough.
<P>"So, are you going to kick me out, or what?"
<P>Tifa didn't bother to look at him.  She suspected he wasn't worried, and had already made himself at home in one of her chairs.
<P>She ignored him, saying to her daughter, "It's okay sweetheart, can you go play with your toys now?"
<P>Karisa glanced at Reno, her mother, and then nodded, wiggling down to hit the floor with a soft pat.  Her attention was stolen, soon after, by play.
<P>"You can at least stay for breakfast," she told Reno, her tone short, as she went back to preparing pancakes. She certainly didn't owe it to him, yet she still didn't feel right just sending him off without at least something to eat.
<P>"Thanks.  All I got at home is some stale cereal." The unfortunate truth.  Reno wasn't keen on grocery shopping.  He ate when he was hungry, which meant he shopped when he was hungry.  Mostly take-out that would have added weight to another man.  He was all sharp angles and lean muscle, unable to gain flesh even when he fought for it.
<P>She wanted to tell him she didn't care what he had at home, but she kept quiet and settled for whipping the batter with more force.  Karisa didn't need to listen to them argue.
<P>Rubbing his fingers across his pants, Reno wished he had a cigarette. His had gotten lost at some point in the scuffle.  He itched for it, in only the way someone addicted can.  But he doubted Tifa would appreciate it anyhow. Though he had never cared much for pleasing people.  Not even someone he most likely owed his life too.
<P>"Isn't that a real kicker," he muttered, watching her cook.  The truth was, he really couldn't have given a damn whether she had come along last night or not.  Maybe she had simply interrupted a payment that was long overdue.
<P>The pancakes and eggs were on the table a short while later.  Tifa watched Reno help himself to a plate, seeming none worse for wear, save for the bruising on his face and the bruising she couldn't see.  The rest had 
obviously done him good. and he seemed to have recovered remarkably well from the damage done to him.  Which made her feel less guilt for making him 
leave once they were done eating. Having him here made her edgy.  He was nothing but a remnant of a past that didn't exist anymore. 
<P>Karisa ate quietly, like she did most things.  She was an unnaturally well- behaved child.  Sometimes, it made Tifa worry, but then she could only laugh, because most mothers probably wished their kids would stop being brats, not start.  Still, whatever Karisa's behavior, her daughter was her life now, and they didn't need Reno disrupting that.
<P>"It's good." Reno washed down a bite of egg and pancake with milk.  It wasn't often he got to eat like this, so whether Tifa believed him serious or not, he was highly appreciative of something decent.
<P>"Thanks," she replied grudgingly, eyes drawn to the bruise that took up nearly half one side of his face.  That had to hurt... It could use ice.  
No.  She shook her head mentally.  He didn't need mothering; he needed a 
hard kick in the ass.
<P>Gesturing to the stack of pancakes, he eagerly took another at Tifa's abrupt nod.  Her entire posture screamed dislike. She was having a difficult time putting up with him without saying something.  Her manners in light of that amused him.  Anyone else would have left him to rot in the alley.  He watched her raise a fork to her mouth stiffly, and felt something tighten and harden inside.  A few decent people were left. So what?  Tifa had taken her share of knocks too, and when it came down to it, he was just in the way.
<P>But he didn't feel like making it easy on her.
<P>The dull thud of something hitting the door interrupted their meal.
<P>"Paper!  I'll get it!" Karisa cried eagerly, and jumped up, running for the door leading off the kitchen.  She brought the paper back a few short moments later, handing it to her mother proudly.
<P>Reno said nothing, figuring he had probably better leave Karisa alone, if he didn't want the milk pitcher broken over his head.
<P>Finishing what was left on her plate, Tifa unbound the paper and skimmed the headlines.  An acute expression of disgust stole over her face.  There was something else there to, something akin to helplessness and possibly even sadness.  Or maybe he was just reading too much into it.
<P>"It never ends," she murmured, brushing hair away from her face.
<P>"What?" He asked, and took the paper before she could protest or offer.
<P>"Meteor Fever, huh?" he mused, looking at the front page. More dead kids, not that it was any concern of his.  Just another example of why the Planet was a screwed up place that <I>should</I> have been flattened by Meteor.
<P>She snatched it from his hands. Dammit, why did he have to be so irritating? She glared at him a moment then quickly scanned the article. Four more deaths from the strange flu like disease that had been spreading across the country ever since Meteor had destroyed Midgar. It seemed to only strike children or young adults and it was invariably lethal. Just the thought of it sent a chill down her back. There was no cure.
<P>He offered her a humorless smile. "You don't see Sci-Co working hard to find a cure.  Why am I not surprised?"
<P>She leveled him with a sharp gaze, leaving him to think he had hit some sort of nerve, and then turned her eyes to his plate.  It was empty. 
<P>"You can go now." she said coldly.
<P>Reno just looked at her for a moment.
<P>"Why are you being so hostile?"
<P>Tifa's eyebrows pinched together. What kind of stupid question was that? 
<P>"Do I have to remind you of what you did to Sector Seven?" she said bitingly. 
<P>He didn't reply for a moment. He hadn't really thought much about what happened back then, back when he worked for Shinra, or what he had done. Nor did it concern him all that much. People died all the time, through sickness, accident or design. He didn't mourn for them just as he didn't expect anyone to mourn for him when he punched his ticket. He didn't blame Tifa or Avalanche for anything that happened back then. He had just been doing his job and so had they, but he knew his point of view was a bit...unusual. He really didn't expect her to feel the same way.
<P>"That was a long time ago," he said slowly.
<P>"As if that makes any difference," she retorted.
<P>For a long time he didn't say anything at all,  just sat there looking at her.
<P>"If you hate me so much, why didn't you just leave me in that alley?"
<P>She hesitated. She hadn't expected him to say something like that. She wanted to say that's exactly what she should have done, but she didn't. She had no idea why she didn't hate him, but seeing him sitting there in front of her with that look on his face, he reminded her of a little kid who had done something wrong without even realizing the consequences. Nor had she expected to hear such a pained tone in his voice.
<P>"I don't hate you Reno," she said slowly.
<P>"So can we just ease up on the negative vibes for a bit then?" he suggested.
<P>Reno saw the anger fade from her eyes and he knew he had her. He kept the hurt expression painted on his face, being careful not to let his inward amusement show. People were so pathetically easy to manipulate, especially women.
<P>"I'm sorry," Tifa said. "But you really do have to go."
<P>"What's the rush, got a hot date?"
<P>Tifa looked away, embarrassed, though she had no idea why she should be.
<P>"Reno, please go." Why did he have to be so infuriating? Wasn't he in the least bit grateful for what she had done for him?
<P>"All right, all right. I know when I'm not wanted." He couldn't resist getting in that one last dig, but the look on her face told him he'd better stop before he went too far. He actually felt kind of bad for toying with her like this, which surprised him a bit, though of course he wasn't about to let that stop him.
<P>He stood up, managing to keep a straight face as pain laced through his legs and back. The night's rest had done him good, but he could see it was going to be a while before he was back to his old self. He would never admit it, of course, but he wasn't all that anxious to leave. All he had to go back to was his own hole in the wall. That place was nothing to him except a place to throw his clothes when he wasn't wearing them. It wasn't anything like this. He couldn't remember the last time he had been in some place that felt like a home.
<P>Not that he cared, of course.
<P>Tifa came up beside him as if to give him a hand, but the look he gave her made her stop. He had had enough of her charity. He was going to walk out the door on his own two feet.
<P>He shuffled over to the door. His legs were still stiff and sore, but he thought he managed a reasonably normal gait. He pulled open the door and turned to look back at her. She was standing by the table looking at him.
<P>"Maybe I'll see you around sometime," he muttered.
<P>She didn't reply.
<P>He hesitated for a moment more, then closed the door. Tifa just stood there for a long time. 
<P>"At last," she sighed. He was finally gone. The whole episode had been so weird. Just running into him had been such a strange happenstance. After all this time...
<P>She gathered up the dishes and brought them over to the kitchen counter. Bending down she pulled open the dishwasher and started placing them inside. An errant lock of hair fell down in front of her eyes. She irritatedly pushed it aside, but she wasn't irritated by her hair. Thinking back over the conversation, she was irritated at herself.
<P>What the hell was wrong with her? She had saved Reno's ass in that alley, brought him to her own home, let him stay the night, did everything she could to help him even though she couldn't stand him and here he had managed to get <I>her</I> to apologize to <I>him</I> for being snippy. 	
<P>"God I am such a jerk," she muttered.
<P>Tifa spent most of the morning cleaning up. Reno had only been there half a day but had still managed to leave the place a mess. Well, she couldn't really blame it all on him, Karisa had contributed as well. After she was done cleaning she reluctantly started on that laundry she had been neglecting. It had to get done eventually and it wasn't going to do itself. If she put it off any longer Karisa wouldn't have any clean clothes to wear. By early afternoon the house was clean, the laundry complete. She sat on the couch with Karisa in her lap , reading her a story. Afterwards she got up to start lunch. The vegetables were simmering merrily in a pot when the doorbell rang. 
<P>Tifa walked over to the door and opened it. A man in a tan overcoat stood there. He smiled, looking at her with pale blue eyes. His hair was short and dark, not a one out of place in spite of the stiff wind that was blowing outside. A thin mustache accented his rather aquiline features. He held a bottle of wine in his hand.
<P>"Hello Brent."
<P>"Good morning," he said, stepping up to her and giving her a kiss.
<P>"Afternoon," she pointed out as he walked in the door. 
<P>He stripped off his overcoat. Tifa took it from him and walked into the hallway to hang it up in the closet.
<P>"Karisa," she heard him exclaim. "How's my little darlin'?"
<P>"Hi Uncle Brent" came the girls voice. "Look at my doll."
<P>"Yes, and a very nice doll it is," Brent said pleasantly as Tifa walked back into the room.
<P>"Lunch should be ready in just a few minutes," she informed him, passing by to return to the kitchen. Brent followed her in, putting the bottle on the table and sitting down.
<P>"I have good news."
<P>"Oh, and what might that be?" Tifa inquired, her back to him.
<P>"I got a promotion."
<P>She glanced at him.
<P>"Really? Congratulations."
<P>"Yup. You're now looking at Sci-Co's new Vice President in charge of the southwest district," he said proudly. "I'll be in charge of acquisitions and construction in Gongaga, Cosmo Canyon and Nibelheim. New office, the keys to the executive washroom, not to mention a substantial raise."
<P>Tifa smiled.
<P>"That's great."
<P>"Thanks," he replied. "Now for the down side. There's a major, major meeting with investors this weekend in Gongaga, and as the new VP I'm going to have to be there. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's going to scuttle our plans for Saturday."
<P>For a second Tifa just stood there, then she quickly turned away, pretending to focus her attention to her cooking, so he could not see the disappointment on her face. Saturday was the anniversary of the day they'd met and they had plans to spend the day together, to go to the theater and a nice restaurant afterwards. She had had to pull teeth to get the day off. 
<P>"Are you mad?"
<P>Tifa stirred the pot of vegetables for a moment before answering.
<P>"No," she said softly. "I understand."
<P>It wasn't his fault. He couldn't help if he had gotten a promotion. She shouldn't be upset, but she couldn't help it. This wasn't the first time their plans had changed at the last minute.
<P>"Are you sure?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>She picked up a carrot and chopped it into pieces on the cutting board, then added it to the pot.
<P>"Look at me."
<P>She picked up the spoon and started stirring.
<P>"I'm trying to cook."
<P>"Look at me," he said, more emphatically.
<P>She sighed to herself, then forced a smile onto her face and turned toward him.
<P>"See, I'm not mad," she said as pleasantly as she could. "I'm happy for you. We'll just do it...some other time."
<P>She turned back to her cooking.
<P>"Thanks for being so understanding," he said, apparently satisfied.
<P>"You're welcome."
<P>"Apparently Sci-Co is planning a major move in Gongaga," he went on. "I think they're going to try to buy out Amalgamated Power."
<P>Tifa used the spoon to take a sip from the pot. Almost done.
<P>"Amalgamated Power?"
<P>"Yeah, that's the largest power company in Gongaga," he replied. "On that continent actually. Taking it over will make Sci-Co one third as big again as it already is."
<P>"Wow," Tifa commented. Brent didn't seem to notice her lack of interest. He never did. She supposed she should show more, after all, it was the company he worked for and she should be glad both he and it were doing well, but because of her experiences with Shinra, she was suspicious of any big company these days, and she had to admit Sci-Co was reminding her more and more of Shinra every day.
<P>She lifted the pot off the stove and drained it, spooning the vegetables out onto a large plate.
<P>She was probably just being paranoid.
<P>She placed the stewed vegetables on the table, along with a large loaf of bread. Brent got up, getting them glasses and opening the bottle of wine.
Karisa laughed as the cork shot over the bookcase and into the living room.
<P>"Time to eat honey," Tifa called out.
<P>Karisa came into the room and hopped up onto a chair.
<P>"So, you're just going to be gone this weekend?" Tifa asked.
<P>"Probably longer," Brent replied. "Even after the meeting I'm going to have a ton of paperwork to go through. The last VP didn't exactly leave the place in tip top shape. At least a week, I would think. Even after that I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling. I'm afraid it's part of the job. It's the only way I can stay on top of things. I'll be gone for some long stretches."
<P>He looked at her closely, obviously concerned with how she would take that. She kept her face studiously expressionless. She supposed it didn't matter, he was hardly ever here now anyway.
<P>"Well, if you must," was all she said.
<P>"I'm sorry."
<P>"You don't have to apologize."
<P>"I'll make it up to you one of these days."
<P>"All right."
<P>The food all prepared and on the table, they sat down to eat.
<P>"I met an old friend yesterday," Tifa ventured as Brent poured the wine. He stopped, staring at her.
<P>"Who?" he questioned, a bit sharply.
<P>For a moment Tifa just looked at him, then she realized what he must be thinking.
<P>"No, not him," she replied. "His name is Reno. He used to be a Turk."
<P>"A Turk?" Brent said, as he finished filling her glass. "Weren't they the one's working for Shinra?"
<P>"Yeah," she replied. She frowned herself, realizing she had just called Reno an old friend. He had hardly been that. What had made her say that?
<P>"So what happened?"
<P>Tifa recounted her adventures of the previous evening while they ate. Brent listened politely, or seemed to. He carried the same expression Tifa thought she must wear when Brent talked to her about his job. That is, until she mentioned Reno had stayed the night.
<P>"He slept here?" he said in surprise.
<P>"Yes, on the couch," she stated.
<P>"And he didn't...try anything funny?"
<P>Tifa gave him a look. Men! Why were they so damn paranoid? Didn't he trust her at all? Like she couldn't make up her own mind about who she was sleeping with. He might as well walk around the apartment peeing on the furniture to mark his territory. 
<P>"No, he was perfect gentleman. Well, that might be a bit generous for Reno, but he didn't put any moves on me."
<P>"Good. Would you like some more wine?"
<P>"No thank you," Tifa replied. They had just about finished lunch now. Tifa looked up at the clock. It as almost three. She stood up and started to clear the plates away as Karisa went back into the living room.
<P>"It's getting late," Tifa said. "I have to get ready for work."
<P>Brent got up and took hold of her hand, stopping her. She looked up at him.
<P>"I was hoping we could spend a little more time together," he said slowly, looking in her eyes. "I did get a promotion after all. I thought we could...celebrate."
<P>Tifa had seen that look in enough guys eyes to know exactly what he was talking about.
<P>"Umm, I really have to get ready for work. We don't have time."
<P>"Well, you can be late, can't you?"
<P>"Bernard will kill me."
<P>"That seems a bit extreme, don't you think?"
<P>"And what about Karisa?" Tifa said, nodding toward her daughter.
<P>"She's playing," he said. "Besides, you have a lock on your door, don't you?"
<P>"Brent."
<P>"What?"
<P>She shook her head, gently pulling her arm out of his grasp.
<P>"I can't now. It's just...I just don't have time."
<P>"I don't know when I'll be back," he made one last effort.
<P>Again she looked at him. She really didn't have time, nor was she in the mood. She had nothing against being spontaneous but why did he have to pick the most inconvenient times for her?
<P>"I'm sorry. I've got to go get ready."
<P>He sighed and sat back down. He poured himself another glass of wine as she walked away.
<P>Tifa went to her room and quickly changed, then made her way to the bathroom. She took out her make up kit, applying it while looking at herself in the mirror.
<P>"Have you been looking for a new job?"
<P>She jumped, turning to see Brent standing in the bathroom doorway.
<P>"Don't scare me like that," she said. "You almost made me screw up."
<P>He looked her over for a moment. She was wearing a similar low cut strapless blouse to the one she had been wearing when she met Reno the day before.
<P>"Have you looked for a new job?" he asked again.
<P>"I've been busy," she replied quickly. "I haven't had a chance."
<P>"Haven't had a chance? How many times have you told me that before?"
<P>She turned to look at him.
<P>"I'm sorry. It's not that easy you know. There aren't a lot of jobs available right now. Most of them don't pay even as much as I get where I am. It's hard to find a decent place."
<P>"You call where you're working now a decent place?" he questioned.
<P>"It's more decent than most," she said, beginning to sound irritated. This was another conversation they'd had more than once in the past.
<P>"That's not saying much," he replied. "I just want you to find a job where you don't have to dress like that!"
<P>"Like what?" she snapped, her eyes darkening. "Like a slut?"
<P>"I didn't say that!"
<P>"No, but you were thinking it!"
<P>He stared at her for a moment.
<P>"Well, you have to admit that blouse doesn't leave much to the imagination."
<P>"It's not that bad!"
<P>"Not that bad? Tifa, if you bend down I bet I can see clear down to your navel!"
<P>"You can not!"
<P>She tossed her highlighter into her make up case and snapped it shut.
<P>"What, do I embarrass you? Is that why you've never introduced me to any of your friends?"
<P>"Tifa."
<P>"You're not my father and you're not my husband," she said, brushing past him. "What I do may not be much but it pays the bills. I have to take care of myself and my daughter somehow. I'm just trying to survive, like everyone else here in Junon."
<P>"There are other ways to do it," he suggested, trying not to sound angry. It was obvious he had set her off again, and he knew provoking her wouldn't help the situation. "What about that martial arts job?"
<P>"I already told you it's only two days a week," she replied.
<P>"I know, but you've been there a few months now. Isn't there any chance of a more permanent position?"
<P>A sudden knock at the door interrupted their conversation. Tifa when over to it and opened it up to reveal a young girl.
<P>"Hi Priscilla."
<P>"Hello Miss. Lockheart."
<P>Priscilla entered. Tifa closed the door then walked over to the hallway closet to get her coat.
<P>"I've already asked. Sensei Rannon says he'd love to have me full time, but the place just doesn't have enough students to warrant it."
<P>"So someplace else then," Brent suggested.
<P>"Like where?" Tifa asked. "None of the other martial arts schools are hiring either."
<P>"It doesn't have to be martial arts," he responded. "You can get a job as a secretary or something."
<P>Tifa just looked at him.
<P>"Oh yeah, that's ambitious."
<P>"And what you do now is?" 
<P>"I don't <I>want</I> to be a secretary," she snapped. "And I also don't want to have this conversation now. I have to go to work."
<P>"Look, I'm sorry, okay?" he said, not sounding sorry at all. "I didn't mean to upset you but I'm only thinking of you. Don't you want to have a better life?"
<P>Tifa just looked at him. She wasn't sure why she was being such a bitch. She just didn't like anyone to tell her how to run her life. His words would carry more weight if she believed him, but she knew it was a lie. He wasn't thinking about her, he was thinking about himself. He was so jealous he couldn't stand the thought of another man looking at her. That was the only reason he wanted her to get another job.
<P>But of course she'd only make things worse by saying that.
<P>"Of course I do," she replied. "But it's not that easy. I can't just wave a magic wand and have the perfect job appear."
<P>"I realize that," he replied. "All I'm asking you to do is keep looking. Now c'mon, I don't want to fight. It's my last day here."
<P>Tifa nodded. She didn't want to fight either. All that crap with Reno must have put her on edge. 
<P>"I'm sorry," she said. "Thank you for the wine."
<P>"Thank you for lunch," he relied. "C'mon, I'll give you a lift to work."
<P>"That's okay. I'll walk. It's not that far," she replied. She knew he was trying to make up, but she wasn't in the mood to talk anymore. She just wanted to be alone.
<P>"Are you sure?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>"All right, have it your way." 
<P>They were both by the door now, ready to go. He looked at her for a moment, then kissed her.
<P>"I'll call you next week to let you know when I'll be back."
<P>"All right."
<P>"I love you."
<P>She looked at him for a moment then turned away. She opened the door.
<P>"Love you too," she said softly.
<P>He kissed her again, then was gone.
<P>Tifa stood there for a moment. It was cold outside, even colder than yesterday. The air was chill and held the threat of snow. She turned to look back inside.
<P>"Karisa, come give Mommy a kiss goodbye!"
<P>Her daughter obediently ran over to her. Tifa bent down and gave her a goodbye kiss, then gently nudged her away, not wanting to expose her to the cold.
<P>"I shouldn't be late today," Tifa said to Priscilla as she stood back up. "There's ravioli in the fridge, you just have to heat it up, and there's also cold cuts."
<P>"Okay Miss. Lockheart," Priscilla said pleasantly.
<P>"Bye," Tifa said.
<P>"Bye Mommy."
<P>"Bye honey."
<P>Tifa walked out the door, closing it and looking back at it forlornly as she started down the street. She missed her daughter so much, even if it was just to go to work. 
<P>She looked around, but Brent's car was gone.  Her shoulders slumped and she sighed, thinking back to their conversation. He wasn't the only one who had lied. She hadn't spoken the truth either. In spite of her last words to him she didn't love him and knew she never would.
<P>So why then did she share her bed with him?
<P>A chill wind blew suddenly down the street. She wrapped her arms around herself to keep warm. 
<P>Because she was lonely. Because it felt so good to have a warm body next to you on a cold night. Was that such a horrible thing?
<P>It wasn't like he was all bad or anything like that. In spite of their spat, he treated her well. He was kind and gentle and not unhandsome.
<P>And he had those lovely blue eyes...
<P>Tifa shuddered, but it was not from the cold this time.
<P>Don't go there, Lockheart. Just don't go there.
<P>She made her way south a few blocks, walking quickly. The chill air felt refreshing but she didn't want to linger too long. She couldn't believe it was this cold and it was only September. It looked like it was going to be a long winter.
<P>She turned a corner. This part of town was more run down than the area where her apartment was. Debris littered the streets, and there was graffiti scrawled on the walls of some of the buildings. Two men stood beside a garbage can with a fire in it down at the corner, warming their hands. The block was filled mostly with bars, porno shops and strip joints. 
<P>Her pumps tapping lightly on the pavement, she swiftly walked down the  block. Stopping in front of one business she glanced up at the sign above her head, a cherubic looking devil with a glowing halo over it's head, and the words Halo & Horns in bright neon lights beside it, before quickly stepping inside.
