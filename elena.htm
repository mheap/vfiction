History: Elena was born in Junon. She was an only child. Her family moved to Midgar early in her life when her father was offered a job with Shinra. Unlike her two future compatriots Reno and Rude, she never lived in the slums. He father was a skilled technical worker and made enough money for his family to live on the upper plate. Though Elena got everything she wanted as a child, she was not really happy. Her father was away most of the time, and her mother seemed to be more interested in playing hostess to her friends and her fathers buisness partners than paying any attention to her daughter. From an early age, Elena was very concerned about her looks. She was jealous of other girls who she thought were prettier than herself, and though she was quite attractive, her low self esteem made it seem to her that almost everyone she knew was prettier than she was. In spite of these feelings of inadequacy, she was still quite popular.
<P>Also from an early age, Elena loved to talk. Throughout her life, she would latch to anyone who would listen and talk about anything at all for hours on end.
<P>Her parents actually encouraged her to get a job at Shinra, and were quite proud of her when she was hired as a secretary at Shinra Headquarters. But by this time Elena had loftier goals. Or perhaps there was a more personal motive involved. She met Tseng shortly after getting the job at Shinra, and she was immedieatly attracted to him. She spent much of her time at Shinra headquarters from that point on plotting on how to get closer to him.  At any rate, she was sick and tired of her parents interfering with her life, and wanted to make a mark of her, make her own decisions. Her mother was very prim and proper, and wanted her daughter to act likewise. Elena could think of nothing that would be less prim and proper than joining the Turks.
<P>At first Tseng kept putting off her requests. But this just made her more determined. And perhaps that grit was a determiing factor. For when Reno was hurt and out of action after a battle with Avalanche, and Tseng found himself suddenly short a Turk and and burdened with the immediate need to hunt down both Avalanche and Sephiroth, he finally relented and let her join the group.
