<p> CHAPTER I
<p> <i><b>FROM THE FUTURE INTO THE PAST</i></b>

<p>Cloud Strife stood at the railing of the bridge of the
Highwind, looking out across Midgar.  Beside him, stood Tifa
Lockheart, her wine-colored eyes filled with worry.  Meteor
had descended on the city and unleashed bright red tornadoes
of destruction.  Pieces of the different sectors were lifted
up and spun through the air as the whirlwinds touched down.

<p> Behind him, Barret Wallace expressed his frustration at
the lack of their savior, the Holy Materia.  Red XIII felt
that it was too later for Holy now and that they should
direct their worries toward Midgar.  Cait Sith bowed his
crowned head atop the enormous, stuffed moogle and shared
his sadness for those his controller Reeve had been unable
to move to the slums.

<p>Suddenly, there was a flash of white light outside the
window and all eyes turned to the source.  They watched in
relief and awe as Holy spread across the Planet and
blanketed Meteor.  There was a struggle between the two
forces and when the battle ended, they were shocked to see
that Meteor remained.

<p> The hope that Aeris had left them with Holy was gone. 
There was nothing left for them to do now but watch as
Sephiroth succeeded in destroying the Planet.  It would
begin with Midgar and end with the destruction of mankind.

<p>They were only allowed a moment of dread before Tifa
noticed something in the distance.  Cloud followed her
outstretched hand and was overjoyed to see bright green
strands of the Lifestream rising from the ground.  Strand
after strand reached up and flowed across the planet,
joining together above Meteor.  The group aboard the airship
shielded their eyes as a flash of iridescent light emanated
from Midgar. When they looked this time, Meteor was gone.

<p> “Hot Damn!” Cid yelled, his cigarette falling from his
mouth. “She did it!”

<p> “We,” Cloud corrected, “we all did it.”

<p> Barret looked at everyone and said, “What now?”

<p> Everyone glanced around at one another, almost as if
they couldn’t believe that it was all over.  Would they go
their separate ways now or stick together?

<p>Tifa shrugged, “I can’t imagine being without any of you. 
Sometimes it’s hard to believe we had separate lives before
all this.”

<p> “I’m-” Cid started, and then, “What the hell?”

<p>They all felt a slight tremor that caused them to lose
their footing and stumble some.  Cid called to his pilots to
check the Highwind’s gauges, but they could find nothing
wrong with them.  Tifa and Cloud turned to look out the
window again, but they too found nothing out of the
ordinary.  Well, that is, if they could call the present
state of Midgar normal.

<p> Vincent Valentine stepped from his usual station in the
rear of the airship and walked up to Cid.

<p> “Something is wrong, friend, I can feel it.”

<p> Cid turned to look at Vincent and nodded.  He also
looked to Red, whose expression seemed to support Vincent’s
foreboding.

<p> “Well, I don’t know shit ‘bout none of that, “Barret
replied.  “I just want the hell outta here.”

<p> “I agree with Barret; although not quite in those exact
words, “ Cait Sith added.

<p> Cid went for the controls and said, “Where the hell to?”

<p> It was then, that the trembling resumed and Cid had to
grab onto the wheel, gripping it tightly to hold his
balance.  Aside from Tifa and Cloud, who had the railing to
latch onto, the others were unprepared and fell the floor.

<p> “Gawd! What is that?!” they heard Yuffie Kisaragi yell
from the cargo bay.

<p> “Shit-can-barely-hold-on!” Cid yelled, his voice shaking
like a car on old, rickety wheels.

<p> Barret tried to stand up and was thrown into Tifa and
Cloud, causing them to release their hold on the railing and
fall.

<p> “Get-off-Barret!” Cloud demanded.

<p> “I’m-trying!”

<p> “Vincent, this would be what you were talking about,”
Cait Sith said, his the only voice that wasn’t shaking.

<p> “Listen-to-that-damn-cat!
Shinra-spy-only-one-can-talk-right!” Barret yelled, managing
to get a grip on the railing and stand up.

<p>The Highwind suddenly moved sharply to the left, and they
were all thrown hard against each other and any metal
objects that got in their way.
<p> “Out-the-window-I-saw-Mako-” Barret tried.

<p> “What?!” Cloud asked.

<p> “Mako-shootin’-up-below-us!”

<p> “Shit!” Cid yelled, as the enormous iron airship was
suddenly pulled down with a vicious jerk.

<p> They watched as Mako rushed by them outside of the ship
and pulled them further into its blue-green reservoir.

<p> “Dammit! Must have been a defunct reactor!” Reeve’s
voice yelled through Cait. “I have a better view and I can
see-oh no! You guys are right in it!”

<p> “@#$%! Thanks-cat!” Barret yelled.

<p> They heard Yuffie scream as the airship suddenly shot
south at a speed so intense, it felt as if their skin was
being pulled away from their bodies.  They went further and
further down until they stopped suddenly, and then,
blackness for everyone.

<p><center>* * * * </center>

<p> Vincent was the first to come to and he found himself in
the Highwind, sunlight pouring through the cracked window. 
The ship had landed on its left side, and he could see his
friends sprawled out everywhere.  It was going to be
difficult, but he needed to maneuver his way out of the
broken, iron bucket and see where they had landed.

<p> He stepped over the plush body of Cait Sith, wondering
at its silence.  Perhaps it had short circuited during the
crisis.  He managed to find the doorway to the outer deck,
but could not see Yuffie anywhere.  When he made his way
onto the deck, he was surprised to see they had somehow
landed outside of Rocket Town.  But, at the heart of the
town, the old, rusted Shinra No. 26 still stood.

<p> He only had a moment to meditate on this before a hand
clamped down on his shoulder.

<p> “Thinkin’ of desertin’ us?”

<p>Vincent turned to Cid, who had a nasty looking cut
running across his forehead.

<p> “No. I am just seeing where we have landed.”

<p> Cid looked out, “Rocket Town. Damn...what the hell? How
did the Shinra 26 get here?!  Those bastards at Shinra
launched it at Meteor. We were inside of it, we saw it
explode!”

<p> “Your guess is as good as mine, friend,” Vincent
replied.

<p> “Vincent, Cid?” they heard Cloud ask.

<p> “Out here Spike!” Cid yelled.

<p> Cloud came into view, followed by Tifa, “Don’t call me
that, Cid. You know I hate it.”

<p> “Sure, Kid,” Cid grinned, reaching for a cigarette.

<p> “How the hell can you smoke at a time like this?” a deep
voice demanded.

<p> “I like the damn things, Barret,” Cid replied, as the
big, black man joined them on the deck.

<p> “Hey! Someone get in here and help me up!”

<p> “Help yourself up, Brat,” Barret replied.

<p> They heard the sounds of debris being tossed aside and
the unmistakable notes of grumbling before Yuffie appeared,
followed by Red and Cait Sith.

<p> “I’m getting funny signals. This is weird,” Cait Sith
said.

<p> “Think that’s weird? Take a look at Rocket Town,” Cid
said, pointing toward it.

<p> “What?! I thought they launched that hunk of junk,”
Yuffie voiced.

<p> Cid turned toward her and glared fiercely, “Watch your
mouth, Kid.”

<p> “I would, but I need a mirror,” Yuffie smartly returned.

<p> Cid took a menacing step toward her, but was detained by
Vincent’s hand on his shoulder.

<p> “Cid, is the Highwind inoperable?” Cloud asked.

<p> “She can fly again, but not without a hell of a lot of
work.”

<p> “How long?”

<p> “’Bout a month or two.”
<p>  “Shit! That ain’t gonna help us now!” Barret spat.

<p> Cid sighed loudly, “What do ya want me to do about it?”

<p> Cloud crossed his arms and stared at the two like a
benevolent father, tapping his foot lightly against the
wooden deck.

<p> Ever the logical, practical one, he said, “Let’s get to
Rocket Town and see what’s going on.”

<p> “The Kids right. Let’s go,” Cid replied, dangling over
the side of the Highwind before jumping down.

<p> “You want me to jump THAT far?” Yuffie whined.

<p> “You wanna stay here all day, Ninja?” Cid yelled up to
her.

<p> At the mention of the word Ninja, Yuffie sighed and
crawled over the side, “If I break any bones, Old man,
you’re dead!”

<p> “You break any bones Kid, and you’re gonna be in too
much pain to even try.”

<p> She managed to get halfway over before she slipped. 
Laughing, Cid darted forward and caught her.  Yuffie looked
up at his beard speckled face, her brown eyes wide with fear
and her breath coming in short, quick gasps.

<p> “Hmmm.  You sure you’re a Ninja?” Cid asked.

<p> Yuffie’s mouth snapped shut and she smacked him upside
the head before jumping out of his arms and running toward
Rocket Town.

<p> “Get back here you little @#$%er!”

<p> Tifa sighed, “Those two.  I swear they are always at
each other’s throats.”

<p> Cloud looked at the rest of the group, “I don’t know
about you guys, but I’d like to find an easier way to get
down.”

<p> Barret nodded in agreement and went in search of a rope. 
Something had happened to the rope ladder when the Mako
reactor has sucked them in, and it was no where to be found.

<p> Vincent smiled at them and said, “I can make my own way
down, as well.”

<p> He suddenly leapt onto the side of the airship and
nimbly jumped down.  The other’s watched as he landed
perfectly on his feet, seeming not to falter at all.  He
then followed the trail kicked up by Cid’s pursuit of
Yuffie, his crimson cape billowing behind him like a fiery
red cloud.

<p> Damn man,” Barret remarked, scratching his head,
“Vince’s got some abilities.”

<p> Cloud turned to him, “You have a rope?”

<p> “Yeah. Don’t know how that’s gonna help Red though.”

<p> Red grinned, revealing even, sharp teeth, “I can go much
in the same way as Vincent.”

<p>  With that, he leapt over the side and onto the ground,
landing steadily on all four feet.

<p> “Show off’s,” Barret grumbled, securing the rope.

<p>  Cloud had Barret go first so that if Tifa fell, Barret
would be below to catch her.  Barret heaved his way down the
thick, tan twine, cursing and bumping into the airship all
the way.  Tifa had to cover her mouth to stifle her laughs,
for fear he’d hear and get angry. She went next, proving to
be much more nimble than Barret and making it down a whole
lot quicker.  Cloud wiggled halfway down and then jumped the
rest of the way, landing easily.

<p> “Show off,” Barret groused, heading for Rocket Town.

<p> When they walked into the town that had risen around the
Shinra 26, they almost bumped into the others, who were
standing about staring as if in a trance.

<p> “It looks the same.  Before they launched the Rocket. 
Damn...I gotta bad feelin’ about this,” Cid said.

<p>  “That’s just not possible,” Cloud replied.

<p> “Yer tellin’ me!” Barret bellowed.

<p> The town stood as it had before the launch of the old
rocket at Meteor.  The people milled about aimlessly, either
walking to no specific destination or just standing there,
staring at the rusted, leaning rocket.  Cid had half a mind
to walk up to the thing and touch it just to see if it was
real.  

<p> “Hey Captain! Didn’t think I’d see you back so soon
after how you took off on the Tiny Bronco. I thought Rufus
Shinra was gonna get you for sure.”
<p> Cid turned to the sound of the voice, shock evident on
his face, “What did you say?”

<p> He walked forward, nearly grabbing the man by the lapels
of his jacket.

<p> The man looked puzzled, “Just that I thought Shinra was
goin’ to get you for sure.  We saw the Tiny Bronco was hit
by those bullets.  We were all afraid you guys crashed and
didn’t make it. Shera’s been beside herself...” he trailed
off, remembering the Captain’s feelings for Shera.

<p> Cid’s face paled and he turned to look at the others,
whose faces wore identical expressions of shock. 

<p> “We just left here? Not...there’s just no way!” Cid
snapped, banging his fist on the back of his head.

<p> “Sure there is Captain, I just...”

<p> He trailed off as Cid rounded on him; the expression on
the Captain’s face told him that he’d better leave real
quickly.

<p> “Uh, sure Captain. Just glad to see you’re all right,”
he said, turning and leaving as fast as his feet would take
him without seeming like he was running.

<p> “Aeris isn’t with us, like before.  This just isn’t
possible,” Tifa voiced, sounding frustrated.

<p> Tifa couldn’t see how after all that they had went
through after this, that they would find Rocket Town like
this, like it was frozen in time.   When they had left on
the Tiny Bronco, Aeris had been alive and with them. She had
been her usual optimistic, cheerful self and Tifa felt a
pang of loss well up in her again.  She and Aeris might not
have always seen eye to eye, but Tifa cared about the girl
like a friend, almost like a sister.  She had watched in
horror as Sephiroth plunged his sword into her slender back,
the blade so long that it came out through her front.  Any
sleep she had gotten after that forced her to re-live the
experience over and over.

<p> Cloud put a reassuring arm around Tifa’s shoulders and
said, “We all know that the Rocket was launched at Meteor. 
Where were we at this point?”

<p> Vincent spoke up, “If I am correct, we went to Wutai,”
he looked sternly at Yuffie after this and she ducked her
head, pretending great interest in her feet, “and then to
the Gold Saucer.  We were after the Keystone.”

<p> “Which the damn Shinra Spy took,” Barret added.
<p> Cait Sith sighed, “Please, Barret, stop mentioning that.
I know I may have been a spy, but haven’t I proved to you
where my real loyalties lie?”

<p> Red padded up to Barret and interjected, “Barret, if we
hope to figure out what has gone wrong, we must work
together.  Exchanging insults will help no one.”

<p> “Red is right,” Cloud spoke up, running a hand through
his blonde spikes, “we need to work together to clear this
up. So leave Cait alone.”

<p> Barret glared fiercely at Cloud, but Cloud simply
crossed his arms and stared back stonily.  Barret sighed and
threw his arms into the air, looking pointedly at their
leader.

<p> “We’re all tired. Why don’t we find somewhere to sit
down and discuss this,” Cloud reasoned.

<p> “Captain.”

<p> The word was spoken softly, but Cid heard it quite
clearly and turned sharply.  Shera stood at the door to his
house, a pot of tea in her hand.  Conflicting emotions arose
as he thought about his feelings for her at this time and
the feelings he had when he first left.  He scratched his
head and turned to the others.

<p> “We can sit around my house. No sense rentin’ a room
when we got free space there.”

<p> Cloud nodded and they followed Cid across town to where
Shera stood.  Her brown eyes were worried beneath her
glasses and her face easily betrayed her anxiety.

<p> “Captain, are you all right?”

<p> Frustration had him snapping at her out of habit,
“’Course I’m all right! What are you blind woman?!”

<p> Shera recoiled, but reached a hand out and touched the
cut on his forehead despite his harsh words.

<p> “You’re cut.”

<p> Cid stared blankly at her, before sighing and trying to
undo the damage of his anger, “Yeah. It’s just a scratch. 
Uh...I’m tired, so you’ll have to excuse me yellin’ at you.”

<p> Shera’s eyes widened in shock. The Captain was
apologizing for yelling at her? She searched his face for
signs of a sickness, but could find none.

<p> To cover her unease, she said, “Come sit down. I’ll pour
you all some tea.  That was quite an escape. I thought Rufus
would get you for sure. But, you disposed of Palmer easily.”

<p> She went to the cupboard for mugs, seemingly unaware of
the tension caused by her words.  Vincent stood in the
corner of the kitchen, Red lay on the floor, Barret leaned
against the fridge; Tifa, Cloud, Cid, and Yuffie sat at the
table, and Cait Sith stood in the corner opposite of
Vincent.

<p> “Shera.  Did you say we just left?” Cid asked, accepting
his mug of tea.

<p> “Why yes,” she answered puzzled.  “You took off in the
Tiny Bronco about two hours ago.  You were running from
Rufus Shinra and the Soldiers...but you already know this.”

<p> “You’re absolutely sure?”

<p> “Captain, why-”

<p> “Dammit Shera, this’ important!”

<p> “Yes, I’m absolutely sure. Oh, where is that nice
girl...Aeris isn’t it?  Something didn’t happen to her, did
it?”

<p> The group grew solemn, and Shera suddenly felt as if she
was intruding on something private, so she excused herself
and left the room.

<p> “Cid, Shera didn’t mean any harm,” Tifa said, thinking
that the thunderous expression on his face was caused by the
other woman’s words.

<p> Cid waved his hand in dismissal, “Hell, I know that. 
This’ just too damn much.”

<p> “I’ve been thinking...” Cait trailed off as everyone’s
eyes turned to him.  

<p> He had never liked being the center of attention, so it
didn’t bother him when the others ignored him.  It was odd,
in a way, that he sat back in Midgar as Reeve, controlling
the big stuffed moogle and its riding cat.  That pretty much
kept him hidden from all of them, yet when he spoke through
the cat he still felt as if they could see him.

<p> “Well?” Barret demanded.

<p> The cat sighed, “What if, when we entered the Mako
reactor, we were somehow thrown back in time.  The
Lifestream sucks you in anywhere and throws you out
anywhere.  It doesn’t seem unlikely then, that this time we
time traveled.”

<p> This revelation was met with silence and blank stares.
If he could have, the cat atop the stuffed moogle would have
began to sweat.  Maybe he had been wrong, but stranger
things had happened to him since joining this group.

<p> “Damn.” Cid said, lighting a cigarette.

<p> Yuffie burst out laughing, “What a ridiculous idea!
Where’d you come up with that story?”

<p> “No, what he says makes sense,” Cloud decided.

<p> And, because it had come from him, the others turned
their attention to their spikey-headed leader intently. 
Cloud looked around at the sea of faces that he had come to
call his closest friends and smiled slightly.

<p> “What Cait said would explain why everything is as it
was before and why everyone keeps insisting we just left.”

<p> “But then,” Tifa wanted to know, “Where is Aeris?”

<p> Cloud sighed.  He wasn’t sure of the answer to this yet. 
It all seemed like an awful lot to grasp all at once. All he
knew was, that they were essentially back right where they
had started. Sephiroth was not defeated and Shinra still ran
rampant. 

<p> “Perhaps,” Red suddenly added, “she still lives.”

<p> They turned to him, wanting to hear what he had to say.

<p> “What if we all still existed too.”

<p> “What?” Barret asked. “Ya lost me Red.”

<p> Red stood up, warming to the subject, “Well, perhaps
what the people of this town just saw leave was us. But not
us as we are now, but us as we were then.”

<p> “Hey! Speak so rest of us can understand!” Yuffie
yelled.

<p> “The rest of us can, Ninja,” Cid replied, dryly.

<p> “Shu-”

<p> “Be quiet,” Vincent said softly, but the steel
underneath had Yuffie closing her mouth and glaring at them
all.

<p> Red swished his tail with impatience and tried again,
“What I am saying is, that there may be two of each of us
running around. Except for Aeris; there will only be one of
her.”

<p> The group absorbed this and then Tifa said, “Then, we
might me able to save her?”

<p> Red inclined his head, “If I am right, yes.”

<p> They sat in silence for awhile. If they were to test
this theory, then they needed to head for the Gold Saucer.
But since the Tiny Bronco was gone, the Buggy had disappeared, and the 
Highwind was not operable, they would
have to go on foot.

<p> Barret shrugged, “What do we have to lose?  We got no
choice but to try an’ stop Sephiroth again.  Might as well
follow the same path we took before an’ try and find the
other ones of us.”

<p> Cloud nodded, “But maybe we could get Shera to fix us
something to eat first? And we need some supplies.”

<p> Everyone looked at Cid hopefully and he shrugged, I’ll
go ask her.”

<p> Cid left the room and Yuffie said with wonder in her
voice, “Ask? Did Cid just say he’d ask her, not tell her?”

<p><center>* * * *</center>

<p> Once they had finished eating and gathering supplies,
they prepared to leave.  With one last look at the Shinra
26, Cid followed the rest of the gang out of the town and
further into the continent.  The next stop would be
Nibelheim and Cid wondered how things would play out there. 
Would Sephiroth taunt them or would things just go as they
had at Rocket Town?

<p> They walked in silence for a moment, alert to the
possibilities of attacking monsters.  Each had their own
thoughts about the days proceedings, but none felt like
voicing them.

<p>  A monster suddenly appeared at Yuffie’s left and she
threw out her Conformer, taking care of it easily.  The look
on her face could only be described as bored. Obviously,
these creatures were no match for any of them.

<p> After some time, they came to the entrance of the Nibel Mountains 
and stopped for a moment.

<p> “Wonder how tough the dragons will be here,” Yuffie
thought aloud.

<p> “I’d just as soon not find out,” Cloud informed her.

<p> They walked through the short path that lead to the
inner cave and then entered it, reaching the bottom where
they had once fought a boss.  The eerie silence of the cave
reminded Yuffie of a tomb and she sought to shake off the
chill. Too bad there wasn’t any new materia here for her to
find.  She still hoped that when this new journey was done,
that they would let her have all their materia for Wutai.  

<p> They managed to make it nearly to the top of the last
set of stairs when a loud roar sounded in front of them.  A
large purple dragon stepped into view and sniffed at the
invaders to his domain.  Seeing that they were humans, he
roared again and stepped forward.

<p> Cloud stepped up to meet him, flanked by Cait Sith who
had the bulk of the defensive materia and Tifa who had a
good portion of the elementals.  Cait cast MBarrier on them
and Cloud ran forward, slicing at the dragon with his Ultima
sword. The dragon roared and swiped at Cloud, who easily
dodged it with a jump back.  

<p>Tifa came around behind the behemoth and gave it a hard
punch and a swift kick to the back.  The dragon swung out
his tail and knocked her from her feet.  Cloud ran in and
helped her up while Cait’s moogle pounded the dragon with
his enormous fists. The dragon roared again and swung his
tail around swiftly, knocking all three to the ground. 

<p> Seeing this, Cid stepped in and used Death Blow to
deliver the fatal hit with his spear.  The dragon died with
one last roar and those not fighting helped the others up.

<p> “Well,” Yuffie said, “I’m kinda glad I didn’t get to
find out.”

<p> Barret pushed her forward and she stumbled into the back
of Vincent, who reached around quickly and kept her from
falling.  Yuffie stuck her tongue out at Barret and ran
ahead to reach the others.

<p> They reached Nibelheim without another incident and
Cloud held up the group, hesitating at the sight of the
mansion.  The others also glanced at Vincent out of the
corner of their eyes to see his reaction.  Vincent’s face
revealed nothing as he gazed at his former prison.  

<p> Tifa gripped Cloud’s hand and smiled, “It’s all right.
You have all of us and we don’t even have to stop.  We can
pass right through.”
<p> Cloud nodded sharply and started forward.  They passed
the dark Shinra mansion, noticing the men in black capes
standing about.  The tension coming off of Cloud could be
felt by everyone near him.  They continued walking, all
holding their breath in anticipation of a visit from
Sephiroth.  When they reached the entrance to the town and
Sephiroth did not show, they sighed audibly.

<p> “Cosmo Canyon is coming soon,” Red interjected. “Perhaps
we could discuss this with my Grandfather.”

<p> Cloud turned to look at Red, “Yes. Maybe that would help
us if we spoke to Bugenhagen.”

<p> From the corner of his eye, Vincent could still see the
Shinra mansion.  When he had joined Cloud and Tifa in a
fight against Hojo, he had thought that perhaps his anger
would be assuaged.  In a way it was, but he knew he would
never forget his stay there, nor the man who was responsible
for it.  It was odd, to him, to be given this chance to save
Aeris.  He wondered how things would be if he was given this
same chance to change the events of his life.

<p> Cosmo Canyon was a bit farther of a walk than from
Rocket Town to Nibelheim and Yuffie sought to fill the
silence with something.

<p> “Wouldn’t it be weird to see duplicates of us? I mean,
two Me’s? Would we even like each other?”

<p> Barret laughed, “We don’t like ya, so why would you like
you?”

<p> Yuffie stuck her tongue out at him again and said, “Oh
shut up. I’ll bet your double hates you too!”

<p> Red walked farther ahead, hoping to put some distance
between the childish arguing and himself.  His wish was that
his Grandfather would be able to give them some wisdom;
perhaps support or refute his thoughts.  Red smiled a little
as he thought of being able to see his Grandfather again. In
his world, Bugenhagen would still have returned to the
Planet. In a way, it would hurt to see him and know that he
would lose him so soon.

<p> Barret ignored Yuffie and thought of Marlene.  Right
now, she would be with Miss. Elmyra, Aeris’ Mom. Kept safe
from all the evil that he was fighting against.  What he
really wanted though, was to be with her always.  But that
was impossible because someone had to stop Sephiroth and
Shinra and he had decided that it was going to be him; with
the help of the others.

<p> They were drawing closer to Cosmo Canyon because they
could see the terrain darkening with the perpetual
red-orange that surrounded the place of peace.  The Canyon
was always a place that they enjoyed to visit.  It left
everyone with a sense of strength and a feeling that they
knew who they were and where they were going.

<p> They came closer to it and were suddenly attacked from
behind.  It was two penguin-like creatures and a peacock
that drained your magic power.  Cloud hated those things, so
he ran forward and sliced it in half with one blow.  Barret
filled one of the penguins full of lead and Red easily
sliced the other to shreds.

<p> “This is too easy,” Yuffie complained.

<p> “Seems to me,” Cid said, puffing away on a cigarette,
“that you were glad not too long ago at not havin’ to face
that dragon.”

<p> Yuffie scowled at him and skipped ahead after Red.  They
came upon the entrance to Cosmo Canyon and the guard at the
gate looked at them all inquisitively.

<p> “Nanaki. We did not expect you back so soon. Elder Bugen
will be very pleased to see you.”

<p> He moved aside and allowed them to pass. Tifa glanced
around and enjoyed the soothing beat of the soft drums being
played.  She yawned and reminded herself that they couldn’t
afford to rest.

<p> Cloud caught the yawn and grinned, “Maybe we should stay
the night.”

<p> Tifa shook her glossy, brown head, “No.  We can’t afford
to. But, if we need to, perhaps we could stay in Gongaga?”

<p> Cloud nodded, thinking of Zack’s hometown.  His thoughts
were interrupted by a shout from above him and he looked to
see Cid motioning for them to hurry up. Apparently, Tifa and
he had fell behind.

<p> “Hurry up you lovebirds!” Barret called.

<p> Cloud glared at him and Tifa pressed her gloved fists to
her face to hide her embarrassment.

<p> “Hush Barret! You know Cloud and I...aren’t that way.”

<p> Barret rolled his eyes and disappeared through the stone
doorway.  Cloud and Tifa jogged to catch up and found
themselves at the ladder to Bugenhagen’s room quite quickly.

<p> “Ho ho ho! Nanaki, I did not expect to see you so soon.”

<p> Bugenhagen, wearing his traditional blue and green robe
floated over to Red.  He glanced at the weary travelers and
then, missing nothing started at the sight of the comb in
Nanaki’s mane.

<p> “Nanaki...where did you get that? I have been saving it
for another time. I do not remember giving it to you.”

<p> Red lowered his head and then lifted it, “It is a long
story Grandfather.”

<p> “Well, tell me then. I’m an old man and time is not to
be wasted.”

<p> Red regaled him with the events that had passed,
neglecting to tell Bugenhagen of his death and then waited
for his Grandfather’s answer. Bugen floated up the stairs
and then returned moments later with a comb identical to the
one in Red’s mane.

<p> “Ho ho ho! This is all so fascinating! So, there are two
Nanaki’s running around. Ho ho ho! Save the Planet.”

<p> The group gave a much needed chuckle and relaxed.

<p> “Can you tell me anything of this Grandfather? Maybe
something that would help us?”

<p> Bugen laughed and said, “No.”

<p> Red looked puzzled.

<p> “Nanaki, I may have lived for many years, but I do not
know everything.  Of time travel, there is little.”

<p> “Then,” Cid shrugged, “We’ll just have to see for
ourselves.”

<p> “This is true,” Bugen agreed. “But, it does my old heart
good to know that the Planet considers us worthy of saving.
Now, Nanaki, why so glum? I know you are hiding something
from me.”

<p> Red swished his tail wishing that he wasn’t so
transparent to his Grandfather.  To everyone else he was an
enigma, but to his Grandfather he was easily readable.

<p> Red bowed his head and went to sit before Bugen,
“Grandfather, I know of the time of your death.”

<p> Bugen laughed again, “Is that all?”

<p> Red lifted his head and stared at his Grandfather,
“But-but-” he was left speechless, something that didn’t
happen to Red often.

<p> “Nanaki. We must all die some day. To return to the
Planet and help it heal is not something to be mourned, but
something to be rejoiced.  I am an old man and I have lived
a long, full life.”

<p> “But Grandfather, I will miss you so.”

<p> The others, deciding that Red needed some time with his
Grandfather, all filed out of the room.

<p> Cloud looked at everyone and said, “We’ll go our
separate ways and meet back here in two hours.”

<p> They nodded and all left, except for Tifa.

<p> “I don’t feel like being alone,” she explained.

<p> Cloud smiled and slipped her arm through his, “Then,
shall we find something to do?”

<p> Tifa grinned, “Yeah.  Let’s go eat some of those
pastries we had here last time. They were the best.”

<p> “You can make better ones.”

<p> “Oh stop!”

<p><center>* * * *</center>

<p> They all stood at the gate to Cosmo Canyon waiting for
Red, who stood with his Grandfather on the last step leading
into the actual Canyon.  Red spoke with Bugen a few minutes
more before bounding down to the others.  He had a smile on
his face and looked at peace.

<p> “I am sorry Grandfather was unable to help us.”

<p> Cloud shook his head, “He did help us. He made us
remember what’s really important in all this. Us and the
Planet.”

<p> “Are we gonna stop at Gongaga overnight?” Barret asked.

<p> Cloud shrugged, “We might. Let’s see when we get there.”

<p> The group left the Canyon completely and was on their
guard for the dragons that liked to cast petrify.  They ran
into a few of them as before they reached Gongaga, but they
easily dispatched them with quick slices and well placed
punches.  
<p> They looked at the run-down town once so thriving and
stopped. The evil of Shinra was everywhere; their touch
marring just about everything they came across.

<p> The group continued forward and prepared to enter the
Gongaga.
