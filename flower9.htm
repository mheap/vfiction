<H4>CHAPTER IX
<P>DOWNFALL</H4>
<P>"Don't you think it's time we headed back?"
<P>Zack glanced at his watch and gave Cloud a dirty look. 
<P>"Back? It's only seven thirty."
<P>Cloud glanced up at the view of the darkening sky afforded them from the narrow street they stood on.
<P>"Curfew is at eight," he reminded his friend.
<P>"How many times do I have to tell you not to worry about that curfew?" Zack replied impatiently. "We've always gotten back in, haven't we?"
<P>That was true. The last two nights, since they had passed their tests, Zack had managed to keep them out well beyond curfew. Both times they had snuck back without getting caught.  Still, that didn't mean they could get away with it forever.
<P>"If we get caught, we'll be in deep shit," he pointed out.
<P>"We're not going to get caught," Zack replied. "And if we do, you know I'll just talk my way out of it."
<P>Cloud sighed. He knew his friend well enough by now to know there was no way he was going to listen to reason. And why should he? Cloud still wasn't sure quite how Zack did it. Whether it was just dumb luck, as Cloud suspected, or whether he was too clever to be caught, as Zack obviously believed, the truth was that Zack had flaunted the rules almost since the day he had arrived, and he'd never been caught.
<P>"The night is young," Zack continued. "We've got plenty more to do. There's a bar in Sector seven we need to visit, and after that we can stop by my girlfriends house. I can't believe we've known each other this long and you haven't even met her yet."
<P>"Sector seven?" Cloud questioned. "You mean down below the plate?"
<P>"That would be where sector seven is," Zack agreed sarcastically.
<P>"I'm sure you're aware it's against the rules for us to go down below the plate," Cloud had to point out.
<P>Zack just looked at him for a moment.
<P>"Yes, quite," he replied.
<P>"And what about this bar?" Cloud continued. "Why a bar? Dance clubs not good enough for you anymore? What are we going to do in a bar? You know we're underage."
<P>"Why do you keep insisting on pointing out things to me that I already know?" Zack questioned. "That's why I want to go to this particular bar. I have it on good authority that they're not too strict about who they serve drinks to."
<P>"I don't think it's a good idea," Cloud stated.
<P>"You know, one of these days you're really going to have to learn how to lighten up a bit," Zack muttered.
<P>Cloud just shrugged as Zack started off down the street, then followed. He didn't feel good about this, but then again, he never felt good about these little excursions, yet for some strange reason, he always seemed to go along.
<P>They took the train down to the lower level, getting off at the last stop, the station in sector seven. Cloud knew Zack had been down here before, but this was his first trip under the plate since the day he arrived. The station itself was bathed in light, but as they walked down the street into the increasing darkness, Cloud began to feel a little uncomfortable. He had heard a lot of rumors about the slums of sector seven, about all the sectors below the plate, about the thieves and gangs that roamed the streets at night. About how everyone with any sense stayed out off the streets once darkness fell. So it was natural he felt a certain trepidation to be down here.
<P>On the other hand, it wasn't like they were defenseless themselves. Zack by himself was a pretty imposing figure, if he hadn't been, he wouldn't have done so well on the physical tests they had just completed. They gangs down here might attack women or old men, or even an ordinary man, but they weren't stupid. The mako glow in both Cloud and Zacks eyes, especially prominent in the darkness, marked them as members of Soldier. They weren't carrying any weapons, but still he suspected that even the strongest gang members or thieves would think twice before confronting someone in Shinra's elite Soldier program.
<P>And it seemed he was right. As they wove their way through the narrow streets they passed a number of people, some singly, some in groups of three of four. All of them were men, and all of them looked perfectly capable of robbery or murder. All of them looked Cloud and his friend over as they passed, possibly out of idle curiosity, or possibly sizing them up as potential victims, but no one bothered them. 
<P>Eventually they reached a small pub, the entrance so small and unobtrusive that Cloud thought he would have walked right past it if Zack hadn't been with him. The sign above the door read 'Maralee's Heaven'.
<P>The smell of liquor and cigarette smoke assaulted Cloud's senses the moment they walked in the door. It was dark inside, the only lighting on the shelves behind the bar, and small lamps with opaque shades on each table that cast a small pool of light on the table surface itself and not much else. It was still early, the room wasn't very crowded. A few people sat at the bar, and two tables were occupied. Zack plopped himself down at one of the vacant tables. Cloud followed suit.
<P>Zack pulled out another chair and stretched his legs out on it. He caught the eye of a blonde waitress in a very short skirt who immediately came over to them.
<P>"Zackie, you made it!" she said, smiling at him.
<P>Zack nodded, returning the smile.
<P>"Did you ever doubt it?" he stated. He nodded over toward Cloud.
<P>"This is my buddy, Cloud. Cloud, this is Tessa."
<P>The waitress tilted her head in Cloud's direction.
<P>"You seem a little young," she observed bluntly.
<P>Cloud just looked at her.
<P>"Is that a problem?" Zack questioned.
<P>Tessa looked around for a moment, then shrugged. 
<P>"I guess not," she replied. "Just don't draw any attention to yourselves."
<P>"We'll be models of restraint," Zack promised.
<P>"So what do you want?"
<P>Zack ordered them both a beer. Tessa smiled flirtatiously at Zack one more time, then walked off.
<P>Cloud leaned forward.
<P>"Do you know <I>every</I> girl in Midgar?"
<P>Zack chuckled.
<P>"Not yet, but I'm workin' on it."
<P>Cloud did not reply. He sat with his arms resting on the table in front of him, trying not to look nervous. He was here, he had decided to come along, it was too late to worry about it. He might as well enjoy himself, otherwise, what the point of tagging along at all?
<P>He looked at the people around them. Except for a couple at one of the tables, Tessa and another woman behind the bar, it was only men. They all had the same rough look as the people Cloud had seen on the way here. 
<P>Tessa soon came back with their drinks, deftly slipping them off her tray and onto the table. She looked at Zack.
<P>"I get off at eleven tonight," she said. "You going to be around?"
<P>For a moment Cloud thought Zack was going to agree, but then he shook his head.
<P>"Sorry, Tess, but I've got to get back to the Shinra complex before that," he said. "But starting next week I should have a lot more time on my hands."
<P>The look of disappointment that had started to appear on her face vanished.
<P>"All right," she replied. "You know my number."
<P>Zack nodded and picked up his drink as Tessa walked off again.
<P>Cloud picked up his beer and took a sip.
<P>"You're girlfriend doesn't mind you flirting with all these women?' he questioned slowly.
<P>Zack shrugged and took another drink from his beer.
<P>"Well, what she doesn't know isn't going to hurt her," he said. "I'm just keeping my options open."
<P>Cloud didn't reply. He wasn't sure he approved, actually, but it wasn't really any of his business.
<P>Zack leaned forward.
<P>"What about you?" he questioned.
<P>"What about me?" Cloud replied.
<P>"You haven't shown any interest in any of the women around here," Zack clarified. "Why is that? You got a girl back home?"
<P>For a moment Cloud just sat there. The question caught him by surprise, and he didn't know quite how to respond. Without thinking his hand slipped into his pocket and curled around the broken ankle bracelet he kept there.
<P>"Well...no...not really."
<P>Zack looked at him closely.
<P>"You don't sound so sure," he observed. "C'mon, I'm your friend right? You don't have to be shy about it."
<P>Cloud looked down at the table for a moment.
<P>"Well, there was one girl who sorta..." he said lamely.
<P>"I thought so," Zack said. "C'mon man, that's nothing to be shy about. What was her name?"
<P>Again Cloud didn't reply. For some reason, he felt extremely embarrassed to talk about this. She hadn't been his girl. They had hardly known each other. 
<P>"Tifa," he said finally. "Her name was Tifa."
<P>"Tifa huh," Zack said slowly. "Was she pretty?"
<P>Cloud nodded.
<P>"Yeah, very," he replied. Saying that didn't seem to do her justice, but he had no words to express how he felt.
<P>"Yeah, well, that's cool," Zack stated. "You've been holding out on me man. You gonna go back there and sweep her off her feet?"
<P>Cloud just shrugged. He really wasn't comfortable talking about this.
<P>Zack seemed greatly amused by Cloud's attitude, but he apparently decided not to press any farther, for he asked no more questions, which was perfectly fine with Cloud.
<P>The young Soldier recruit wasn't sure exactly how long they remained at the bar. His recollection of the night was a bit fuzzy afterward. He had had a drink or two in his day, but had never had access quite like this before, and, having very little experience with drinking, it didn't take much to get him tipsy. Because of foolish pride, he tried to keep up with Zack for as long as Zack noticed, but after a while Zack obviously had had more his share himself and stopped	keeping track of whether Cloud was drinking along with him or not. At that point Cloud slowed down, and it was good thing he did, for, though slightly drunk, at least he was conscious when the fight began.
<P>Even so, he wasn't exactly sure what started it all. He was pretty sure someone had said or done something to Tessa that Zack had taken exception to. Snide remarks had turned to angry shouts, which had quickly escalated to blows. They had been outnumbered, but the combination of alcohol in their veins masking the pain and mako enhancement made them formidable foes. After a while Cloud wasn't even sure who he was fighting, or who was on who's side, for by that time the entire bar was involved in the battle. He distinctly remembered throwing one man over the top of the bar, and at another time feeling the crack of a bottle that smashed against his head, but at the time, it had only pissed him off even more. Eventually there had been shouts, and he had seen Shinra security forces running into the bar to break it up. At that point Zack had grabbed hold of him and dragged him toward the back exit. Even in their inebriated state, they both knew the consequences of getting caught here. Cloud had been running right behind Zack when suddenly a huge man, taller even than Zack, wearing an apron stained from cooking had appeared in front of him. The last thing Cloud remembered seeing was a large frying pan coming straight at his face.
<HR>
<P>"Mr. Strife."
<P>Cloud groaned.
<P>"Mr. Strife."
<P>He opened his eyes and blinked at the harsh light shining through a window. He turned his head away. It took a moment for things to come into focus for him. When they did he saw bars in front of him. 
<P>But that wasn't the worse part. Standing on the other side of the bars was Capt. Hendricks.
<P>"Glad to see you've decided to join us again among the living," the Capt. commented.
<P>Cloud pulled himself up to a sitting position. The movement made his head swim. He looked around. It didn't take a genius to figure out he was in a jail cell. He only vaguely remembered what had happened last night, but what he did remember was enough to tell him he was in deep trouble.
<P>A Shinra guard unlocked the cell.
<P>"Come along Strife," the Capt. said, even Cloud being able to hear the disgust in his voice.
<P>Cloud stood up unsteadily. His brain still wasn't fully functional. He couldn't believe this was happening. He had been so confident, so sure that they wouldn't get caught. Zack had always managed to get them back safely.
<P>Where was Zack?
<P>"Captain, I..." Cloud began, but Hendricks just held up his hand.
<P>"Save your excuses for when we talk to the Colonel."
<P>Cloud fell silent, following the Capt. out and into a Shinra vehicle. They were both silent as the Capt. drove back to Shinra headquarters. Cloud's mouth was dry, his stomach doing flips. He knew Hendricks had no love for him, and he had been caught violating half a dozen rules. He wracked his brain to come up with some kind of plausible story, but he wasn't Zack, he couldn't think of anything that had any chance of sounding believable. He didn't think even Zack would be able to talk his way out of this one.
<P>Were they going to throw him out of the program?
<P>He felt panic welling up inside him at that thought. He was certain the Captain would expel him from the program without a second thought, but the Colonel might be more tolerant. Cloud hadn't talked to him much, or even seen him, but when they had spoken he had seemed like a reasonable man. They had just been having a little fun. They hadn't meant any harm. Surely the Colonel would understand.
<P>What had he gotten himself into?
<P>He should never have listened to Zack. It was all his fault anyway, now wasn't it? He would have never been out there in the first place if Zack hadn't prodded him, hadn't assured him that everything would be all right, that they couldn't possibly get caught. It was obvious that Zack hadn't gotten caught, otherwise he'd be in the car along with them. How had that happened? Had he abandoned Cloud, run off to save his own hide? If he told them it was all Zack's idea, would they go easier on him?
<P>His musings were interrupted as they pulled to a stop in front of the Shinra building.
<P>"The Colonel is expecting us," the Capt. said as they got out of the car.
<P>They weren't wasting any time, were they?
<P>The Colonel had a grim expression on his face as Cloud walked in. Capt. Hendricks took a seat beside the Colonel's desk. Cloud remained standing.
<P>"Now," Capt. Hendricks said, "would you care to explain to the Colonel exactly what you were doing in a restricted area after curfew?"
<P>"I..I was just," Cloud began. He didn't know what to say. He was caught. There was no way out. There were no excuses. There was nothing for him to say except to tell them the truth. "I just wanted to have a little fun."
<P>"A little fun," the Captain commented.
<P>"Yes," Cloud replied. "Training was difficult. It was hard to pass the tests. I guess I just felt the need to celebrate a little bit. I didn't mean any harm."
<P>"So you went to a bar in sector seven," the Capt. said.
<P>"Yes," Cloud replied.
<P>"Who else was with you?" the Capt. questioned.
<P>"No one," Cloud replied. He didn't know what had happened to Zack, but he couldn't believe his friend would have just left him there.
<P>"By yourself?" the Capt. said, the skepticism obvious in his voice.
<P>"Yes, by myself," Cloud repeated.
<P>"Tigana wasn't with you?"
<P>"No."
<P>The Captain stared at him.
<P>"Breaking curfew. Going into a restricted area. Drinking. And now, lying to a superior officer. The infractions just keep piling up, Strife."
<P>"I'm not lying!' Cloud said, trying to sound convincing.
<P> The Captain, however, did not look very convinced.
<P>"C'mon Strife. You're insulting us. I know you and Tigana are always together. I know he was with you because, frankly, you're too stupid to do something like that on your own. Do you seriously expect us to believe he wasn't with you."
<P>Cloud just remained stubbornly silent.
<P>"I suggest you tell us the truth," the Colonel said.
<P>Cloud just looked at them both for a moment.
<P>"I am," he said finally.
<P>The Captain made a sound of disgust.
<P>"Let me make this easy for you Strife,' he continued. "We don't want you. We know you're not the brains behind this. We know it was Tigana. What you've done is more than enough to get  you expelled from the program. I know you want to protect your friend, but is it worth that? You remain silent and I guarantee you you're out. You tell us that Zack was with you, and maybe we can be lenient."
<P>Cloud said nothing, just stood there. Out of the program. They couldn't. They just couldn't do that to him. After all he'd been through. After all his hard work. He couldn't believe they'd throw him out for this.
<P>He hadn't come here to make friends. He'd told himself that before. He'd only known Zack a few weeks. Why should he be loyal to someone he hardly know? Someone who had left him the moment things had gotten difficult?
<P>Zack was no friend of his. He only thought about himself. He had dragged Cloud into this, after all, with no thought of the consequences. It was all his fault, why shouldn't he be the one to pay the price? This wasn't fair!
<P>In spite of his thoughts Cloud remained silent. He wasn't ever sure why, but he just couldn't do it. He couldn't rat out on his friend, no matter what the consequences.
<P>He looked up again.
<P>"Colonel, I was just having a little fun," he pleaded. "I didn't mean any harm. I've never done anything like this before."
<P>"You mean you never got <I>caught</I> doing anything like that before," the Captain stated.
<P>"Do you have any proof of that?' the Colonel questioned.
<P>Captain Hendricks hesitated.
<P>"No sir," he said finally.
<P>"So why don't we just confine ourselves to the facts here,' the Colonel said.  
<P>He turned to look at Cloud.
<P>"I'm not going to sugar coat this," the said. "The charges here are very serious. Half a dozen rules of the program's code of conduct were broken. I know you might have just been having a little fun, I know you might think that what you did was harmless, but that's just not true. The Soldier program is Shinra's elite program. Only the best get in, and their behavior is expected to be exemplary. If you break the rules, if you get caught in a bar like a common hoodlum, you've tarnished not just yourself, but the entire program. That will be neither accepted or tolerated."
<P>Cloud nodded, a lump in his throat.
<P>"Captains Hendricks is right," the Colonel continued. "What you've done is grounds for expulsion from the program. I'm afraid if you don't have anything more to say about it, I'll be forced to comply with his request."
<P>Cloud just stood there, feeling like he was going to throw up. 
<P>"Do you have anything else to say?" the Colonel questioned. He didn't seem angry. In fact, he seemed to be prodding Cloud to talk, but what could he say? He'd been caught. There was no excuse for what he had done. His only out seemed to be to lay the blame on his friend, to rat him out, but no matter how much he kept telling himself to do just that, he just couldn't bring himself to.
<P>After a long pause the Colonel finally shook his head slowly.
<P>"Very well," he said. "You leave me with no choice. Go back to your dorm and pack your things, Strife. You're out of the program."
<HR>
<P>"There you are!"
<P>Cloud had just walked into the dorm room. He hardly seemed to notice as Zack came rushing up to him.
<P>"What happened to you last night man?' Zack questioned. "I thought you were right behind me when we ran out the back. Those guys still wanted to fight in the back alley. By the time I took care of them and came back in the bar, everyone was gone. You didn't get caught, did you..."
<P>Zack's voice faded as he saw the look on Cloud's face.
<P>"What happened?" he questioned, his voice serious.
<P>Cloud just shook his head. He didn't want to say anything, didn't want to talk. He couldn't believe this had happened. He couldn't believe he was out of the program. He pushed past Zack and walked like a zombie toward his bunk.
<P>"Cloud?" Zack said.
<P>He reached his bunk and stopped, staring down at it. Zack was right beside him.
<P>"You did get caught, didn't you?" Zack said. "What happened? What did they say to you? Are you going to be punished?"
<P>For a long time Cloud said nothing at all. He was afraid to speak. He was afraid if he opened his mouth, he'd break down and cry, and he didn't want to do that. Certainly not here, not in front of all the others.
<P>"I'm out," he finally managed to say.
<P>He wasn't looking at Zack, couldn't see his reaction.
<P>"Out?" Zack replied. "What do you mean, out?"
<P>Cloud didn't reply, just bent down and starting pulled his backpack out from under his bed.
<P>Zack's eyes grew wide.
<P>"You mean, out of the program!" he exclaimed.
<P>Cloud still didn't say anything. Zack suddenly grabbed hold of him and spun him around.
<P>"Out of the program?" he demanded.
<P>Cloud's mouth moved, but nothing came out. Finally he nodded.
<P>Zack let him go, stepping back with his mouth open.
<P>"But...but they can't. They can't do that now. You passed the tests man. You're in. They can't throw you out just because of this."
<P>"Yes they can," Cloud finally found his voice. "And they did."
<P>Zack just stood there in shock.
<P>Cloud turned around again, lifting up his backpack and dropping it on his bed. What was he going to do now? He had no place to stay in Midgar. What else could he do but go back to Nibelheim. Go back to Nibelheim and tell them he got thrown out, that he was a disgrace, a failure. 
<P>What would his mother think?
<P>How could he ever face Tifa again?
<P>"Didn't you tell them it was my fault?" he heard Zack shout.
<P>Cloud turned to look at him.
<P>"I said I was by myself," he replied. 
<P>Zack looked at him in surprise.
<P>"By yourself. You didn't tell them about me?"
<P>Cloud shook his head.
<P>"Well there you go then!" Zack said. "I'll just go tell them the truth. I'll tell them it was my idea, that you were just along for the ride."
<P>He turned but Cloud grabbed his arm.
<P>"No," Cloud said. "They'll just throw you out too."
<P>Zack spun around.
<P>"Well, I <I>deserve</I> it!" he exclaimed. "It was my idea. They can't do that to you. It's not fair!"
<P>Before Cloud could say another word, or stop him, Zack stomped off.
<HR>
<P>"There's been a three percent increase in the physical reaction time from the latest enhancements to the mako infusion process. I think this needs to be adjusted for in the training, specifically..."
<P>Captain Hendricks was cut off abruptly as the door to the Colonel's office suddenly opened.
<P>Zack walked in and stopped when he saw the Colonel and the Captain staring at him.
<P>"It was me!" he exclaimed before they could say anything.
<P>For a moment they didn't respond, then a slow smiled curled on the Captain's lips.
<P>"It was with Strife," Zack continued. "In fact, the whole thing was my idea.  He didn't want to go. I talked him into it. If you want to blame anyone, blame me."
<P>The Captain slowly stood up.
<P>"So," he said thoughtfully. "We finally get the truth. You admit to being with Strife? You admit to breaking curfew,  going into a restricted area, and drinking?"
<P>"Yes," Zack said without hesitation. "If you want to punish someone, punish me."
<P>"Oh, don't worry about that," the Captain replied. "You will be. You realize that any of those infractions taken alone could result in your being expelled from the program?"
<P>"I don't care," Zack replied. "I don't care what you do to me. Just reinstate Cloud. It wasn't his fault."
<P>"He went along with you, didn't he?" the Captain questioned.
<P>"Yes," Zack said tightly. "But he only did it because I talked him into it."
<P>"And you think that's an excuse?"
<P>Zack hesitated for a moment, trying to keep his face completely expressionless. 
<P>"I realize that Cloud might have shown poor judgement, but that's all he's guilty of. I didn't have to come in here. I didn't have to tell you any of this. It was all my idea. I'm the one you really want. Can't you show some leniency to him?"
<P>"No one forced you to confess," the Captain replied. "You came in here of your own free will. We do not negotiate with trainees who break the rules. Strife is just as guilty as you are. Soldier is Shinra's elite program. We accept only the best. Discipline <I>must</I> be maintained. What kind of example would we be setting if we let Strife off the hook? How would we prevent things like this from happening in the future? The truth is that you and Strife have been flaunting the rules since the you arrived here. You've treated this like it's some kind of game. Oh no, don't try to deny it. I've had my eye on you. I've seen what you've been doing, and so have the other trainees. The others look up to you, Tigana, but you're a bad example. You're just what we don't want in this program, someone who thinks the rules were meant for someone else. I've waited a long time for you to slip up, and don't think I'll going to let you <I>or</I> Strife sweet talk your way out of this one."
<P>He turned to look at the Colonel.
<P>"Sir, I recommend that Tigana join his friend in being expelled from the program."
<P>The Colonel tapped his pen on the desk in from of him. Zack couldn't read his expression, but he seemed...uncomfortable.
<P>"Tigana, you're dismissed. Go back to the dorms," he said finally.
<P>Zack frowned.
<P>So did Captain Hendricks.
<P>"Sir?" he said.
<P>The Colonel looked at Zack.
<P>"Go."
<P>"Sir, I protest," the Captain blurted out. "Mr. Tigana has broken the rules of conduct. A ruling for expulsion is quite clearly called for here. The code of conduct..."
<P>"That will be quite enough, Captain," the Colonel cut him off.
<P>The Captains stood there. He opened his mouth, then shut it again. The Colonel glared at Zack.
<P>"Yessir," Zack replied smartly, then turned and left the room. As soon as the door closed the Captain swung around toward the Colonel, his face red.	
<P>"Sir, I demand an explanation!" he exclaimed. "As the evaluation officer, I have the right to recommend expulsion of any student I deem unfit, and I..."
<P>"You can't expel Tigana," the Colonel stated simply.
<P>The Captain looked more confused than ever.
<P>"Sir, the rules <I>clearly</I> state..."
<P>"Forget about the rules," the Colonel cut him off. "Tigana stays. There's nothing you or I can do about it. The order comes right from the top."
<P>The Captain looked bewildered.
<P>"I don't understand sir."
<P>The Colonel sat back in his chair, a sour look on his face.
<P>"You've seen Tigana's scores on the physical tests?"
<P>"Of course," the Captain replied. "They're exceptional. Better than anyone I've ever seen in the program before, but..."
<P>"They are," the Colonel cut him off again. "In fact, they're better than anyone since Sephiroth himself. That hasn't been lost on the higher ups in Shinra. Hojo himself is said to be intrigued. I have orders direct from him to make sure that Tigana becomes a Soldier."
<P>The Captain just stared at him.
<P>"His classroom work hasn't been that impressive," the Colonel continued. "So his instructors have been a little creative grading his papers. Shinra doesn't care about any code of conduct transgressions. Hojo apparently thinks he's got something special here, and we all know Hojo gets whatever Hojo wants."
<P>The Colonel dropped his pen and leaned back in his chair, folding his arms across his chest.
<P>"So as you can see, it doesn't matter what Tigana did. There's more to it than just someone breaking the rules here. Politics are involved in everything, in every decision we make. As an officer who often has to deal with Shinra executives, you should know that as well as I. I may not like it any more than you do, but the simple fact is, you can have Strife, but you can't touch Tigana."
<HR>
<P>"Cloud!"
<P>Cloud did not reply, nor even turn his head, just continued walking down the steps of the Shinra building.
<P>"Cloud!" Zack said again, running up beside him.
<P>Cloud stopped, still not looking at him.
<P>"I told them," Zack said. "I told them it was all my fault."
<P>"So now you're out too?"
<P>"I don't know. The Captain wanted to, but the Colonel just told me to go back to the dorm."
<P>Cloud shrugged.
<P>"You shouldn't have said anything."
<P>"I had to <I>try</I>," Zack replied.
<P>Cloud looked down at the backpack he held in his hands, the backpack that held all his possessions. For some reason he had never realized before just how little he possessed.
<P>"Yeah, well, thanks for that anyway."
<P>He started walking again. Zack strode beside him.
<P>"I'm sorry," Zack said. "It was all my fault. I never thought..."
<P>"No, it wasn't your fault. I didn't have to go with you. You didn't force me."
<P>Zack hung his head. In spite of Cloud's reassurance, he couldn't help but blame himself.
<P>"Don't leave yet. They still might change their mind," he said. 
<P>Cloud just shook his head.
<P>"You don't really believe that, do you?"
<P>They reached the bottom of the stairs. Cloud stopped.
<P>"Where you gonna go man?" Zack asked.
<P>Cloud didn't reply. Where was he going to go? He supposed he had no choice but to go back to Nibelheim. He didn't want to. He never wanted to show his face there again. How could he ever face them? But what else could he do? He couldn't stay at the dorm anymore. He had no place to go here, and very little gil. 
<P>"I don't know," he said finally.
<P>Zack stood there for a moment, then reached into his pocket and fumbled around for a moment. 
<P>"Here," he said, extending his hand. "Here's the key to my place. You can stay there, at least until you figure out what you want to do. Don't leave yet, there's still a chance they might take you back."
<P>Cloud didn't really want to, but really didn't think there was any chance of him being reinstated, but what else could be do?
<P>He accepted the key.
<P>"Do you want me to come with you?" Zack asked.
<P>Cloud shook his head.
<P>"No, no, I'd rather be alone right now."
<P>Zack looked at him closely.
<P>"You sure?" he said. "It's not any trouble."
<P>"Just leave me alone Zack," Cloud responded.
<P>Zack backed off.
<P>"Yeah, sure," he replied. "If you need anything just let me know, okay?"
<P>Cloud didn't respond, just started walking again.
<P>Zack stood there watching him go.
<P>"Just don't do anything stupid, okay?" he called out.
<P>Cloud glanced back, but said nothing. He looked up. The Shinra building towered over him, over all of Midgar. For a moment he had thought he might actually become part of that. For a moment he had actually thought his dreams might come true, that he might amount to something, that he might make a mark in this world. 
<P>He should have known better.
<P>He turned away, and walked down the street, leaving the Shinra building and all his dreams behind him.
