<P> CHAPTER VI
<P> <i><b>FRIEND OR FOE</i></b>
<P>Cid began to think quickly what they had done last time they were here. 
<P>Elena was now bringing her hand back for the punch
<P>"Oh yeah! Dodge left!" Cid thought. He ducked to the left as Elena swung.
<P>She toppled over and began to roll down the hill, screaming as she went.
<P>"Elena!" cried the two Shinra guards that had accompanied her, as they
run down the hill after her.
<P>"That was easy enough" said Yuffie
<P>"Yeah", said Cid pulling cut a cigarette and turning to the group, "now
what do we do?"
<)P> No one spoke for a moment then came the voice of Red XIII.
<P>"I suggest we head for Holozoffs Cabin. That is where we headed the last 
time, is it not?" he said.
<P>"You'll get no argument from me" said Cait
<P>"Alright then, let's go" said Cid and they headed off towards Gaei Cliff.

Tifa continued to walk aimlessly through the forest. The silence was
nerve racking.
<P>I guess that's why its called the Sleeping Forest, thought Tifa. She 
continued to walk down the path, but then stopped and sat down up against
a tree. She sighed and thought. She thought about yelling at Aeris and then
she thought about leaving the group and she sighed again.
<P>"Maybe it was a mistake to leave", she thought, "It was really selfish"
She continued to ponder on it and came to a decision.
<P>"Thats it. I'm going back" she said. She got up and started to run back
down  the path towards the City of the Ancients. Suddenly she saw a figure in the brush about 10 feet in front of her. Tifa came to stance, 
preparing for the worst. The figure did not move.
<P>"Show yourself!" yelled Tifa. The figure began toward her. The light
slowly  began to reveal the face, and Tifa was surprised to see who it was.
<P>"Rufus", Tifa said not coming out of stance. Rufus stopped and held up
his hand.
<P>"Easy Miss Lockheart. I'm not going to hurt you." he said.
<P>Tifa glared at him looking for some hint of deception. She saw none. She came out of stance but she kept her senses at full alert in case of trickery.
<P>"It's just Tifa, Rufus", she said, "What do you want?"
<P>Rufus just smiled and began to circle Tifa.
<P>"Funny, I was going to ask you the same question."
<P>"What?" Tifa said not taking her eyes off of Rufus.
<P>"Why are you here?" he repeated, "Why are you not with the rest of your 
little party?" 
<p>Tifa began to search her mind for a quick answer.
<P>"I'm...looking for Cloud", she said, "he's missing" 
<P>Tifa bit her lip. You idiot, she thought, just let Rufus know he's missing. Now he'll have all of Shinra out looking for him on a search and destroy mission.
<P>"And the rest of the group?" asked Rufus. Tifa began to look for another 
excuse. She was running out of things to make up.
<P>"Um...probably looking for me. I left on my own to find Cloud while they 
were asleep.
<P>Rufus chuckled. 
<P>"Wrong, I just received a report from Elena over my PHS. 
They are in Icicle Inn and they are heading for Gaei Cliff as we speak."
<P>"Your point Rufus?" said Tifa
<P>"My point is that they seem to have no interest in you or Cloud for that 
matter.", he said, "They are just worried about themselves and all
the glory they are going to receive for there work."
<P>"They are not fighting for glory Rufus", said Tifa angerly, "They are 
fighting to save the planet from destruction."
<P>Rufus began to laugh. Tifa was now getting mad. This little game of his
was getting old, fast.
<P>"Whats so funny" she demanded
<P>"You are so naive", he said between laughs. TIfa was now seconds from
making Rufus a greasy spot in the dirt. He finally stopped
laughing. He looked at her and smiled.
<P>"Come with me, Tifa.", he said, "Since it seems that I am the only one
that gives a damn about you"
<P>"Why should I?" said Tifa letting her anger die down.
<P>"Because like I said, I am the only one that seems to give a damn about
you." 
<P>Rufus extended his hand
<P>Tifa thought about it. How could she go with him?  He was the enemy. The
one she was fighting against to save the planet.
<P>"No", she said softly, "I...I can't" 
<P>Rufus lowere his hand and came in close to Tifa
<P>"Why not? I promise I won't hurt you" he said
<P>Tifa thought about his offer again. She scanned his voice in her head 
searching for anything that would give a hint of his intentions.
She could find nothing, but she sensed something in his voice. It was
almost an urgency, like he was in...she shook the thought from her mind. Impossible, she thought to herself.
<P>"Well?" asked Rufus extending his hand again.
<P>Tifa took and deep breath and answered. "Alright",she said softly and 
reluctanly took his hand, "but if you do anything to me or the rest
of AVALANCHE while I'm with you, I swear I'll rip you apart. You hear 
me?!"
<P>Rufus smiled wickely, "Fair deal" he said and they headed back toward
Bone Village.

Cid and company ended up at Holozoff's Cabin towards the end of the day.
The sun was just beginning to fall behind the mountains. Cid
could not be happier. He was just one more complaint from throwing Yuffie 
back down the slope. She had complained so much about not
being able to walk in the cold snow that Cait had ended up carrying her
up the slope in his big moogle arms.
<P>"Are we there yet, Cid? Now my arms won't move" she said in her best 
whiney voice. Cid stopped.
<P>1...2......10!!! he thought. He turned and headed for Yuffie. Barret 
jumped in front of him.
<P>"Don't Cid", he said, "As much as I would love to throw that pain in the
ass back down the hill myself we are just a few minutes from the cabin.
Just put up with it a little longer." 
<P>Cid breathed deep, turned, and
started back up the hill. In a few minutes they arrived at the cabin door.
Cid knocked. A friendly voice told them to come on in and they entered
the cabin."
