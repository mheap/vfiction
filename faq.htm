<P><B><A NAME="question1">Do you post other people's stories on your website?</A></B>
<BR>If you look around the site, you will notice the answer to that it no. There are many reasons. A couple of the more significant ones are, one, Geocities only allows me 15 MB of space. I only have about 2 left. If I posted other peoples stories on my site, I'd run out of room real quick. Two, reading through and posting other people's stories takes a LOT of time. I'm already stressed for time as it is. Considering the fact that there are plenty of sites out there that post other people's stories, I don't really think it's necessary for me to do so.
<P><B><A NAME="question2">I don't have a lot of time on the internet. Can I download your stories in .txt format?</A></B>
<BR>Unfortunately there is no simple way to download all my stories at once. I write my stories in .txt format, but make the final edits after I've converted them to HTML. Not to mention that fact that the spelling in the .txt files is atrocious, there can be some significant differences between them and the final product. If you don't have a lot of time online, the only thing I can suggest you do is download the HTML files chapter by chapter and read them offline when you have time.
<P><B><A NAME="question3">Can I use your stories on my site?</A></B>
<BR>Yes, anyone can use my stories on their site if the wish. You don't even have to ask permission, (but it would be nice to hear from you, and if you let me know you've posted any of my stories, you get a link in return). The only criteria is that you MUST give me credit for the story and post my email address along with it.
<P><B><A NAME="question4">What's the story with links?</A></B>
<BR>I'm link free. Anyone can link to me without asking. As in 3, however, if you let me know, I will link back, as long as your site has something to do with Final Fantasy, RPG's or fanfiction.
<P><B><A NAME="question5">When are we going to see the next chapter of so and so. I can't wait!</A></B>
<BR>The creative process knows no deadline. ^^ How long it takes me to write a chapter can vary by a GREAT deal. Sometimes I can sit down for a day and write five or six pages, and sometimes five or six sentences. I usually try to post a new chapter every two weeks, though that not set in stone.
<P><B><A NAME="question6">Will the internet series EVER end?</A></B>
<BR>Well, I could always get hit by a truck...But seriously, I honestly can't really say when it will end. At the moment I've got plans for a book 8 and 9 (but 9 will be a bit...unusual). After that, we'll see. To tell you the truth, when I started I never thought it would last as long as it has. I thought you people would get fed up with my babbling long ago!
<P><B><A NAME="question7">You can't end the series until you've tied up all these loose ends!</A></B>
<BR>Life is not tied up in a neat little package. I try to make my stories as realistic as possible (keeping in mind, of course, the fantasy framework I'm working within) and there are always loose ends in life. Even if I definitely decide to end the series, you can be quite sure there will still be things unresolved at the end. That's just the way it is.
<P><B><A NAME="question8">Will you read this story I wrote and give me some tips?</A></B>
<BR>This is kind of a tough one. For one thing, it's a matter of time. I get a lot of requests like this and although I try it's hard to devote time to reading everything that's sent me (and I admit I've been VERY bad about this at times). For another thing, even if your story sucks, I'm too nice to say that. I don't want to discourage ANYONE from writing. I'm sure I'm a lot older than most people who visit my site. When I was young, my writing was pretty bad, but I kept at it and I got better. The last thing I want is to say to someone is that their writing isn't that great and have them give up when they could have gone on to be a great writer. Finally, I don't think I'm QUALIFIED to give advice. I'm not a published author. If you want advice from an expert, you shouldn't be talking to me. Bottom line here, if you really want to send me a story to look at, go right ahead, but it will probably take me a while to get to it and I honestly don't think I'll offer much useful advice.
<P><B><A NAME="question9">The site looks a bit plain. Why don't you jazz the place up with some fancy graphics.</A></B>
<BR>This site is based on content, not flash. Most people come here to read the stories, not ohh and ahh at the graphics. Plus flashy graphics take a long time to load and don't always work on all computers. In order to ensure the largest possible audience, I want my site to work with any browser set at any resolution. Besides, I kind of like the booklike atmosphere of the place.
